# Gear Picker for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2

A mod that helps you automatically optimize your gear selection for different scenarios in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.

## Features

This mod uses the underlying logic and tooling of the "Helmet Off Dialog" mod to provide gear optimization capabilities:

- **Automatic Gear Optimization**: Select the best gear in your inventory for:
  - Maximum Armor/Protection
  - Maximum Stealth
  - Maximum Charisma

## How It Works

The mod uses a technique to identify equipped items by measuring weight changes when items are unequipped. This approach is necessary because the game doesn't provide direct API access to determine which items are currently equipped.

## Planned Features

- Custom gear profiles that can be saved and loaded
- Hotkey support for quick gear switching
- Enhanced UI for gear selection

## Installation

[Installation instructions to be added]

## Development

This mod is currently under active development. See the `/docs` folder for implementation details and progress updates.

## Credits

This mod uses the underlying logic and tooling from the "Helmet Off Dialog" mod by Rizart Dokollari, but has been completely repurposed for gear optimization.
