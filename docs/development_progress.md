9. ✅ Created detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 (Inventory Logging)
10. ✅ Implemented inventory scanning and logging functionality
11. ✅ Extended core classes for comprehensive stat collection
12. ✅ Created GearScan class for inventory analysis
13. ✅ Renamed and restructured mod for gear optimization functionality
14. ✅ Created new GearPicker namespace (replacing HelmetOffDialog)
15. ✅ Archived original dialog-related functionality for reference
16. ✅ Implemented GearOptimizer placeholder for optimization algorithms
17. ✅ Created GearSwitcher class for handling gear switching functionality
18. ✅ Updated commands to support gear optimization and preset management
19. ✅ Fixed compatibility issues with old HelmetOffDialog code
20. ✅ Implemented enhanced error handling and compatibility modules

## In Progress

1. 🔄 Implementing optimization algorithms for different gear scenarios (armor, stealth, charisma)
2. 🔄 Creating preset management system for saved loadouts
3. 🔄 Testing and refining core functionality

## Code Organization Updates

- Renamed primary namespace from `HelmetOffDialog` to `GearPicker`
- Moved all core files from `Scripts/HelmetOffDialog/` to `Scripts/GearPicker/`
- Removed dialog-specific files that are not needed for gear optimization
- Created new utility classes specific to gear optimization
- Added compatibility reference in GearPicker.lua to support legacy references to HelmetOffDialog

## New Core Files

1. **GearPicker.lua**: Main class that initializes the mod and provides factory methods for other components
2. **GearScan.lua**: Implements comprehensive inventory scanning and analysis
3. **GearOptimizer.lua**: Handles optimization calculations for different scenarios
4. **GearSwitcher.lua**: Manages switching between different gear loadouts and presets

## Recent Findings & Changes

1. **Enhanced Stats Collection**: We've successfully implemented comprehensive stat collection for all gear items:
   - Defensive stats (Stab/Slash/Blunt)
   - Stealth stats (Visibility/Conspicuousness/Noise)
   - Social stats (Charisma)
   - Physical properties (Weight/Condition/Cleanliness)
   
2. **Material Detection**: Implemented reliable material type detection for different gear:
   - Plate armor detection based on naming patterns
   - Chainmail detection for mail items
   - Leather and cloth material identification
   - Comprehensive categorization for all 16 armor slots

3. **Hotkey Configuration**: Updated hotkeys to support gear functionality:
   - F6: Scan and log inventory items (previously F5)
   - F7: Optimize for maximum armor protection
   - F8: Optimize for maximum stealth
   - F9: Optimize for maximum charisma

4. **Command Structure**: Implemented comprehensive command system:
   - Equipment optimization commands
   - Preset management (save/load/list/delete)
   - Configuration options for optimization priorities

## Next Steps

1. 📝 Complete implementation of optimization algorithms in GearOptimizer.lua
2. 📝 Add layering enforcement to ensure proper gear dependencies
3. 📝 Implement weighted scoring for different optimization scenarios
4. 📝 Create preset saving and loading functionality
5. 📝 Implement auto-detection of combat/stealth situations
6. 📝 Add UI elements for easier interaction with the mod
7. 📝 Create comprehensive testing scenarios for all core features

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Compatibility with Legacy Code
As the mod evolved from HelmetOffDialog to GearPicker, we encountered issues with legacy code references and functions.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive compatibility module that handles legacy references and properly patches global functions to prevent errors while maintaining compatibility with existing mods or save files.

### Challenge: Implementing Proper Layering Logic
To ensure that armor is equipped in the correct order, we need to carefully manage the layering dependencies.

**Solution**: Implemented layering rules in GearSwitcher and Equipment classes to ensure that necessary base layers are equipped before outer layers.

### Challenge: Balancing Multiple Optimization Goals
Optimizing for different scenarios requires balancing multiple competing stats.

**Solution**: Created configurable weighting system that allows different priorities for various stats based on the optimization goal (armor, stealth, charisma).

### Challenge: Efficient Gear Switching
Switching between different gear loadouts needs to be efficient and handle dependencies.

**Solution**: Implemented GearSwitcher class that manages the sequential unequipping and equipping of items in the correct order.

## Future Considerations

1. Adding support for custom gear mods
2. Creating visual indicators for the current optimization mode
3. Adding contextual awareness for automatic optimization based on situation
4. Creating a more advanced UI for preset management
