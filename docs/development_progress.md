# Development Progress

## Current Status

**Project Stage**: Initial Setup

**Last Updated**: May 13, 2025

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Updated repository and code references from 'kcd2_helmet_off_dialog' to 'kcd2_gear_picker'
2. ‚úÖ Created new README.md with updated mod description and features
3. ‚úÖ Created documentation framework in the docs folder:
   - Current functionality documentation
   - Implementation plan
   - Development progress tracker (this document)
4. ‚úÖ Updated project to use a single mod structure instead of multiple optional mods
5. ‚úÖ Set up project with proper folder structure and organization
6. ‚úÖ Analyzed KCD2 game data files to understand the equipment and armor systems

## In Progress

1. üîÑ Analyzing the existing code structure to understand current gear handling mechanisms
2. üîÑ Designing the new gear optimization systems

## Code Organization Notes

- The main implementation will focus exclusively on the code in `src/main/` directory
- The code in `src/helmet_only/`, `src/random/`, and `src/ranged/` is kept for reference only and will not be used
- These reference directories contain variations of the original mod, each with their own manifest files

## Recent Findings

From our analysis of the KCD2 game data files, we've gained valuable insights into the game's equipment system:

1. **Equipment Classification System**: KCD2 has a complex equipment classification system with clearly defined:
   - Equipment parts (head, torso, arms, etc.)
   - Body parts and subparts (detailed anatomical mapping)
   - Layering system (inner/outer layers for different materials)
   - Armor archetypes (detailed specifications for different armor configurations)
   - Armor types (categorization of specific armor styles)

2. **Attachment System**: The game uses specific attachment slots for equipment, which will be essential for our gear management.

3. **Layering Mechanics**: The game data confirms our understanding of the layering system, with clear distinctions between:
   - Base layer (body)
   - Inner layers (cloth_inner, chainmail_inner, plate_inner)
   - Outer layers (cloth_outer, chainmail_outer, plate_outer)
   - Decorative elements (decoration_inner, decoration_outer)
   - Underwear (base clothing)

These findings validate our implementation approach and provide the necessary details to develop accurate gear categorization and optimization algorithms.

## Next Steps

1. üìù Extend our item detection mechanisms to use the KCD2 equipment classification system
2. üìù Implement comprehensive categorization system for all gear types based on the game data
3. üìù Create layering compatibility validation system
4. üìù Implement gear stats analysis system
5. üìù Develop optimization algorithms for Protection, Stealth, and Charisma
6. üìù Create a command interface for the optimization features

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Identifying Equipped Items
The game doesn't provide a direct way to detect which items are equipped. The existing mod uses a weight-based detection system.

**Solution**: We'll extend this approach to work with all types of gear by tracking weight differences for each gear slot, using our improved understanding of the game's equipment system.

### Challenge: Item Categorization
The game has many different items, and we need to properly categorize them for our optimization algorithms.

**Solution**: Leverage the game's own categorization system from the data files to accurately classify items based on their types, archetypes, material, and body parts.

### Challenge: Layering Compatibility
We need to ensure that optimized loadouts respect the game's layering requirements.

**Solution**: Use the body_layer.tbl data to create validation rules that enforce proper layering during optimization.

### Challenge: Balancing Stats
For stealth and charisma modes, we need to balance multiple competing stats.

**Solution**: Implement a weighted scoring system that allows configurable priorities between stats, using the game's own stat categories as a foundation.

## Future Considerations

1. Adding UI elements to make the mod more user-friendly
2. Creating visual indicators for the current optimization mode
3. Making the system compatible with other equipment mods
4. Adding support for saved equipment profiles for different situations
