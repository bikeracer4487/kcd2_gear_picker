# Development Progress

## Current Status

**Project Stage**: Initial Setup

**Last Updated**: May 12, 2025

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Updated repository and code references from 'kcd2_helmet_off_dialog' to 'kcd2_gear_picker'
2. ✅ Created new README.md with updated mod description and features
3. ✅ Created documentation framework in the docs folder:
   - Current functionality documentation
   - Implementation plan
   - Development progress tracker (this document)
4. ✅ Updated project to use a single mod structure instead of multiple optional mods
5. ✅ Set up project with proper folder structure and organization

## In Progress

1. 🔄 Analyzing the existing code structure to understand current gear handling mechanisms
2. 🔄 Designing the new gear optimization systems

## Code Organization Notes

- The main implementation will focus exclusively on the code in `src/main/` directory
- The code in `src/helmet_only/`, `src/random/`, and `src/ranged/` is kept for reference only and will not be used
- These reference directories contain variations of the original mod, each with their own manifest files

## Next Steps

1. 📝 Extend item detection to cover all gear types
2. 📝 Implement gear stats analysis system
3. 📝 Create armor optimization algorithm
4. 📝 Create stealth optimization algorithm
5. 📝 Create charisma optimization algorithm
6. 📝 Develop command interface for the optimization features

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Identifying Equipped Items
The game doesn't provide a direct way to detect which items are equipped. The existing mod uses a weight-based detection system.

**Solution**: We'll extend this approach to work with all types of gear by tracking weight differences for each gear slot.

### Challenge: Item Categorization
The game has many different items, and we need to properly categorize them for our optimization algorithms.

**Planned Solution**: Create an expanded categorization system that classifies items based on their names, types, and stats.

### Challenge: Balancing Stats
For stealth and charisma modes, we need to balance multiple competing stats.

**Planned Solution**: Implement a weighted scoring system that allows configurable priorities between stats.

## Future Considerations

1. Adding UI elements to make the mod more user-friendly
2. Creating visual indicators for the current optimization mode
3. Making the system compatible with other equipment mods
4. Adding support for saved equipment profiles for different situations
