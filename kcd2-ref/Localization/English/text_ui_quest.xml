Once you leave the crone and maiden standing behind the gates, then boldly go towards midnight into cold chambers of rock. 
You shall pass through the hall of the kings of the forest, where they hide themselves from the hunter, and your goal is then protected by just two guards of sandstone.
Between them is a mighty rock, but it has a niche, where one gives one's heart to God, and there my armour lies hidden.</Cell><Cell>Finding the first part of Brunswick's armour certainly won't be easy, but if I give it some thought, I'll manage. Scribe Gaibl told me a riddle that should lead me to my goal. It went something like this: 
Take your leave of crone and maiden, standing tall behind the gates, boldly go towards true midnight, in caverns cold your prize awaits. Pass through the hall of forest kings, hidden deep from hunters' gaze, standing tall two guards of stone, behind whom yearned-for treasure lays. Between them stands a mighty rock, a subtle niche yet deeper still, a place to give one’s heart to God, behold my armour gleaming still.</Cell></Row>
