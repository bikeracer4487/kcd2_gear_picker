<Row><Cell>andelstrazny_oresmus_book_tVjY</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;God be praised, here begins Aristotle's treatise On Heaven and the World, which I, Nicole Oresmus, dean of the church of Rouen, propose to translate and explain in French by order of the almighty and most illustrious Prince Charles, the fifth named, by the grace of God, king of France, seeker and lover of all noble wisdom.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;This work bears this title because it treats of the heavens and the elements of which the world is composed, the word world including the four elements contained in and under the heavens; for in this treatise the world is commonly interpreted otherwise to mean the whole mass of the heavens together with the four elements.

<Row><Cell>andelstrazny_oresmus_book_ukm3</Cell><Cell>1. In the first chapter, Aristotle proves that the world is perfect in both quantity and size.&lt;br/&gt;
2. In the second chapter, he explains how bodies in the world are capable of three simple movements.&lt;br/&gt;
3. In the third chapter, he applies his observations regarding local movements to several earthly bodies.&lt;br/&gt;
4. In the fourth chapter, he presents five reasons why, in addition to the four elements, it is necessary to assume another simple body.&lt;br/&gt;
5. In the fifth chapter, he shows that the heavens are neither heavy nor light.&lt;br/&gt;
6. In the sixth chapter, he suggests that the heavens could neither have been created, nor corrupted, nor increased, nor decreased, nor changed.&lt;br/&gt;
7. In the seventh chapter, he presents three proofs of what he has just stated.&lt;br/&gt;
8. In the eighth chapter, he shows that circular movement is not contradictory.&lt;br/&gt;
9. In the ninth chapter, he aims to determine whether there exists any infinite body.&lt;br/&gt;
10. In the tenth chapter, he shows that it is impossible for a body moving in a circle to be infinite.&lt;br/&gt;
11. In the eleventh chapter, he shows that no body capable of straight-line motion can be infinite.&lt;br/&gt;
12. In the twelfth chapter, he shows that neither heaviness nor lightness can be infinite.&lt;br/&gt;
13. In the thirteenth chapter, he broadly argues that no body can be infinite, basing his reasons on the rules governing local movement.&lt;br/&gt;
14. In the fourteenth chapter, he shows that no body can be infinite, using reasons based generally on all types of movements or actions.&lt;br/&gt;
15. In the fifteenth chapter, he presents other, more general and less obvious reasons to show that no body can be infinite.&lt;br/&gt;
16. In the sixteenth chapter, he proposes to determine whether there exist or can exist multiple worlds, and with two arguments proves that they cannot.&lt;br/&gt;
17. In the seventeenth chapter, he proves with another argument that there can only be one world.&lt;br/&gt;
18. In the eighteenth chapter, he proves that the elements move to certain specific places without the distance to them being infinite, which he had previously assumed.&lt;br/&gt;
19. In the nineteenth chapter, he refutes views contrary to what is stated in the previous chapter.&lt;br/&gt;
20. In the twentieth chapter, he again proves with two reasons that there can be only one world.&lt;br/&gt;
21. In the twenty-first chapter, he presents the reason why some believed that multiple worlds could exist.&lt;br/&gt;
22. In the twenty-second chapter, he finds an answer to the above argument, thereby confirming his view.&lt;br/&gt;
23. In the twenty-third chapter, he shows that no living body can exist outside this world, which he had previously assumed.&lt;br/&gt;
24. In the twenty-fourth chapter, he shows that there is nothing concerning a living body outside this world.&lt;br/&gt;
25. In the twenty-fifth chapter, he begins to question whether the world is eternal, and discusses the views of other ancient thinkers.&lt;br/&gt;
26. In the twenty-sixth chapter, he refutes Plato's view.&lt;br/&gt;
27. In the twenty-seventh chapter, he refutes the views of Empedocles and Anaxagoras.&lt;br/&gt;
28. In the twenty-eighth chapter, he precisely explains various concepts that he will continue to use.&lt;br/&gt;
29. In the twenty-ninth chapter, he addresses the problem of the possible and the impossible with respect to a given force.&lt;br/&gt;
30. In the thirtieth chapter, he asserts and begins to prove that everything that had a beginning, and all things subject to change, will have an end, and also that everything that ends had or will have a beginning.&lt;br/&gt;
31. In the thirty-first chapter, he tries to prove as a universal law that what is not without a beginning is not without an end, and if it is not without an end, then it is not without a beginning; also, that what has no beginning is eternal, and if it is eternal, it is without a beginning.&lt;br/&gt;
32. In the thirty-second chapter, he shows how certain concepts used in this area of study are translatable.&lt;br/&gt;
33. In the thirty-third chapter, he again tries to prove that everything that had a beginning will necessarily have an end, and that everything that will have an end had a beginning.&lt;br/&gt;
34. In the thirty-fourth chapter, he further argues the same problem.&lt;br/&gt;
35. In the thirty-fifth chapter, he defends the idea that all perishable things will necessarily be destroyed, and further argues the previous question.&lt;br/&gt;
36. In the thirty-sixth chapter, he provides another more specific reason from natural science to support his claim.&lt;br/&gt;</Cell><Cell>1. In the first chapter, Aristotle proves that the world is perfect in both quantity and size.&lt;br/&gt;

<Row><Cell>fairystory_houseofruthard_ntwf</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;Z&lt;/inc&gt; and the reign of the good King Wenceslas II. Přemyslovec, a fever for precious metals broke out in Kutná Hora. Many people came every day to Kaňek and Kuklík to seek their fortune on the surface and underground. There was so much pure silver flowing out of the furnaces that even the last miner could get rich if he had not drunk it all before or had not met with misfortune in the mine. And those who didn't return were not few. But nothing could discourage the profitable miners from opening new shafts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Along with the miners, rich merchants also came to Kutná Hora, who rented the mines from the king to extract white metal from them at their own expense and thus increase their wealth even more. To prove that they were successful in their work, the patricians began to build exhibition houses and palaces, and soon a large town with several markets and a town hall was established. A little later, high walls were also erected to guard the peace and wealth of the upper town.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;One of the first to come to the mountain to try their luck was the German Ruthard family, who established a manor on Kolmark above the river Vrchlice, where silver in the knickerbockers rose to the surface in abundance and had therefore been mined here for ages. Jan Kunklín Ruthard was a well-known miner and erckaufier in Kutná Hora, so when King Václav II himself visited Kutná Hora, he offered him a treat in his house. The king, impressed by the choice food and the wealth of Ruthard's house, realised that Jan must be well versed in silver mining, since he was doing so well. &lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;What was the king's astonishment when, after a good meal, John took him into the cellar, where the silver bars lay on top of each other like ears of silver in a sheaf. Then the king asked John for the first time: Whose silver is all this, Ruthard? And he answered him wisely: Thy king, if ever thou hast need of it from me. The king, pleased with these words, shook his head and told John that he had no need of it yet, but would remember it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Later John accompanied King Wenceslaus to Vespers in the monastery of Sedlec. On the way, the king asked his guide who owned the meadows they were passing through, and John told him: You, gracious king! But I manage them, and I pay every year ten white groschen to the abbot of the monastery for their use. &lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The king promised to intercede, and in good humour turned his horse to a willow tree that grew by the roadside. He broke off a branch from it and handed it to John, saying: Let this sprig be a reminder to posterity of my grace for the sincerity with which you have shared your treasures with me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Ruthard understood the king's words, and while Wenceslaus stayed in the monastery, he hastened to the city, where he had the royal hand and the sprig painted on his shield. When Wenceslas saw the new decoration on his shield, he confirmed the coat of arms and with it the dignity he had achieved for his family that day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;D&lt;/inc&gt;uring the reign of the good King Wenceslas II of the Premyslides, a fever for precious metals broke out in Kuttenberg. Many people came every day to Gang and Kukliek to seek their fortune on the surface and underground. There was so much pure silver flowing out of the furnaces that even the last miner could get rich if he had not drunk it all before or had not met with misfortune in the mine. And those who didn't return were not few. But nothing could discourage the profit-hungry mine owners from opening new shafts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Along with the mine owners, rich merchants also came to Kuttenberg, who rented the mines from the king to extract white metal from them at their own expense and thus increase their wealth even more. Proving that they were successful in their work, the patricians began to build great houses and palaces, and soon a large town with several markets and a town hall was established. A little later, high walls were also erected to guard the peace and wealth of the upper town.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;One of the first to come to Kuttenberg to try their luck was the German Ruthard family, who established an estate on Kolmark above the river Vrchlitz, where silver in the fissures rose to the surface in abundance and had therefore been mined here for ages. Jan Kunzlin Ruthard was a well-known mine owner and erckaufier in Kuttenberg, so when King Wenceslas II himself visited Kuttenberg, he offered him hospitality in his house. The king, impressed by the selection of food and the wealth of Ruthard's house, realised that Jan must be well versed in silver mining, since he was doing so well. &lt;/paragraph&gt;Imagine the king's astonishment when, after a good meal, Jan took him into the cellar, where the silver bars lay on top of each other like ears of silver wheat in a sheaf. Then the king asked Jan for the first time: 'Whose silver is all this, Ruthard?' And he answered him wisely: 'Yours, King, if ever thou hast need of it from me.' The king, pleased with these words, shook his head and told Jan that he had no need of it yet, but would remember it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later Jan accompanied King Wenceslas to vespers in the monastery of Sedletz. On the way, the king asked his guide who owned the meadows they were passing through, and Jan told him: 'You, gracious King! But I manage them, and I pay every year ten white groschen to the abbot of the monastery for their use. Please plead with him, so I pay less.' &lt;br/&gt;The king promised to plead, and in good humour turned his horse to a willow tree that grew by the roadside. He broke off a branch from it and handed it to Jan, saying: 'Let this sprig be a reminder to posterity of My Grace for the sincerity with which you have shared your treasures with me.'&lt;br/&gt;Ruthard understood the king's words, and while Wenceslas stayed in the monastery, he hastened to the city, where he had the royal arm and the sprig painted on his shield.

Unfortunately, the crate was near the fabrics and I will now have to ventilate them in the attic and hopefully the smell can be eradicated. I must tell Jerome that his stinking secret has to be carried by another foreman. &lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

&lt;paragraph&gt;After a tour of the meat shops, a new deal is struck with Jimram the butcher, whose meat is generally better than the quality, and since he knows me well, he will hopefully forgive the usual antics of his guild. There are six pigs and three cattle to be slaughtered next week. Besides this, he will supply one and a half piles of sausages and salamis, a sufficient supply of bacon and other sausages.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;heading&gt;June 8th&lt;/heading&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Borek the master carpenter came to inspect the attic and make repairs to the truss. The price he offered me was very good, but after a proper treat and a few glasses of wine he still agreed to another discount. I may have to persuade the constables to give the carpenter the job of repairing the roof at the Town Hall, but someone has to do it. Borek may not be very handy, but he's cheap enough. So I'm actually saving the city's coffers.</Cell><Cell>&lt;heading&gt;June 12th&lt;/heading&gt;

<Row><Cell>klasternitajemstvi_wineen_D4Zh</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Some say that a true connoisseur will most enjoy a wine that is virgin, not flavored or spiced. It should be added that this is what the connoisseurs themselves claim, so that they can proudly exalt themselves above the common people, who are forced to drink watered-down, flavoured or spiced wines. However, this idea stems from the ingrained habit of using flavours and spices to mask the taste of wine that is spoiled, vinegary or otherwise bad-tasting. The truth is, however, that if adulterants are added to a good wine, the resulting drink will be enjoyed even by a wine connoisseur with a tongue accustomed to refined flavors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Such a spiced wine is called &lt;accent&gt;hippocras&lt;/accent&gt; after the Greek physician Hippocrates because he is credited with the invention of the sieve by which coarse impurities can be removed from liquids. This is a necessary process in the case of hippocras, since many hard, spicy fruits are broken down into small impurities by maceration in wine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;As I have written before, each region has its own mores and the same is true of the ingredients that are put into hippocras. In Bohemia, the most common are various aromatic spices, probably: cinnamon, ginger, cloves and of course honey to add sweetness. Spices that are pungent such as pepper or bitter such as cumin or aniseed are never added. In the Czech Republic, hippocras is also called hippocras only for spiced white wine drinks while the same drink made from red wine is called claret, which may confuse foreigners because claret is also a wine style from the Bordeaux region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Some say that a true connoisseur will most enjoy a wine that is virgin, not flavoured or spiced.

<Row><Cell>klasternitajemstvi_wineen_fZRI</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Many of us are certainly familiar with Galen's theory of the four &lt;accent&gt;humors&lt;/accent&gt; or four bodily fluids. According to this ancient theory, the balance of the four bodily fluids: blood, mucus, bile and black bile affect our body and health. Even a small imbalance can affect our physical and mental health. Classical medical science addresses the imbalance of these fluids and ways to bring the humors back into equilibrium.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;But beyond that, doctors are also looking at the effect of personal diet on these fluids. It can certainly be understood that apart from solid food, the fluids we take in affect the balance in the first place. Water, as is well known, is the only neutral fluid. But we will deal with wine. Red and full-bodied wines are associated with blood &lt;accent&gt;(Greek haima)&lt;/accent&gt;. Thus, red wines are warm and full of life. On the other hand, white wine is associated by most ancient physicians with mucus &lt;accent&gt;(Greek phlegma)&lt;/accent&gt; and by some with black bile &lt;accent&gt;(Greek melaina chole)&lt;/accent&gt;, which are cold and dead fluids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Balance needs to be maintained especially in relation to age. In fact, our bodies are very rarely in balance. Young people have an excess of blood in them and should therefore drink white wine. This will enable them to calm down and not succumb to youthful passions. Old people, on the other hand, have more mucus and are cold, so they should drink red wine, which will give them vigour.
&lt;paragraph&gt;In addition to age, the composition of the diet and especially the pairing of wine with particular dishes should be taken into account. Here again, there should be a balance between the liquid (wine) and solid (food) components. Determining which liquid predominates in the dishes is a rather more complicated problem. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;It is generally thought that anything that has been circulated by real blood can be associated with the blood of Galen. Even if the food contains no blood. It is therefore good to drink white wine with all meat, game, sausages or offal. Although many gourmets are convinced otherwise. The exceptions are aquatic animals, i.e. freshwater and marine fish, crabs, crayfish, mussels and other aquatic creatures. These are cold by definition. The situation is quite the opposite for plant foods such as vegetables, fruit, baked goods, various porridges and pulses. These are cold foods, and even then only if we associate their growth with heat (e.g. melons). We therefore drink red wine with these foods.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

<Row><Cell>klasternitajemstvi_wineen_Op2R</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;As we know, wine can take on a wide range of qualities. From almost-tasteless and bitter wines, which are more suitable for cleaning metal objects or pickling vegetables, to rare, exclusive and even rarer wines. We do not need to mention the wines from the first group, as the reader is surely aware of a number of wine bars where they can torture their throats with poor-tasting wine. But of the wines of the second group the reader would certainly like to know more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;As the saying goes, "Different region, different mores", and this is of course true of the more highly regarded wines. In the whole Italian peninsula there is no more famous and valuable wine than &lt;accent&gt;Vin santo&lt;/accent&gt;. This is a style of wine that is made from the Malvasia or Trebbiano grape. It is a so-called straw wine. The harvested grapes are dried on straw under a well-ventilated roof. The result of this process is a very sweet wine, which a certain parish priest in Tuscany is said to have used to perform miraculous cures on people infected with the plague.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;In France, which is considered by many to be the land of winemakers, there is no more famous vineyard than the Pope's near Avignon. This French city is known to the reader for its canonical machinations with the papacy, but the vineyard here was established under Pope Clement the Fifth, long before the schism to which the Christian community is subjected today. Thus it may be said that any &lt;accent&gt;vin du pap&lt;/accent&gt;, or papal wine, is highly prized. Particularly the Burgundy style wine, which has the longest tradition in the vineyard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;In the nearby Germanic countries, one of the most valuable wines comes from the vineyard at &lt;accent&gt;Eberbach Abbey&lt;/accent&gt;, which can astonish one with its gargantuan size - many say it is the largest vineyard in the world! One might say that large quantities and high quality do not go together, but the opposite is true. The Cistercian monks of Ebberbach are known for their strict adherence to procedures and their wines are among the best that the German lands have to offer.

Given our good relationship, I would like to ask a small favour of you. The bearer of this letter is one Henry of Skalitz, the eldest son and sole heir of a wealthy miner family who has decided to invest their fortune in a smelting enterprise alongside their silver mines. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I would be very grateful if you would allow Henry to visit your works and get to know the smelting operation up close, so to speak. His family has significant influence in the Sasau region and you would certainly find him a useful friend.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will be in your debt&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Further to our previous conversation, I must express my satisfaction that the irregularities at the Horschan mines have been taken care of. Let us hope that the difficulties that have been plaguing us for the past few weeks will not repeat. I continue to have full confidence in you and your men.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The revenue from our small venture is growing, so I decided to increase your net pay. The payments for the use of the privileges that you enjoy as the owner of the smelter in Grund will remain in the full amount for the time being, insofar as you pay them from your net earnings, which have recently considerably increased thanks in part to my activities outside the mint.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am very busy right now, so we will not be meeting at the usual place by SG at the usual time. Give our dear artists my greetings and make sure they have everything they need. Let Volkmar take care of it.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;I: The Year Ninety-Eight&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Vashek, the shepherd from Sukov, son of Milota, carpenter from Grund, confessed under torture that he stole a skirt and a belt with a bag in Kuttenberg. He then confessed that he went stealing rye and geese with Petr Maly from Sedletz from a farmer in Pschitok. He stole a good coat, boots and a shirt from the farmer Petr Kuklik. He lost all of it gambling in Kuttenberg, and the local innkeeper paid him eight groschen for it, even though the neighbour Vanyek told her the coat was stolen. The innkeeper replied, "Stolen or not, that's fine"
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;II: The Confession of Jira the Thrice Wicked&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Jira, called Shourek, confessed that he killed a townsman from Brod on the road near Wysoka, taking from him three score of groschen, clothes and a good horse. He further confessed to killing a certain Nicholas on the Kolin road and also a German, who tried to harm him with his testimony. Then, along with three accomplices, Matthew from Krzesetitz, a certain Jakubek from Maleshov and Martin Dlouhy from Rabstein, they attacked the bailiff in Bylany because he discovered their theft of thirty horses. Finally, he confessed that they all frequented Rabstein and sent the miller under Cimburk to sell the goods.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;III: Anno et cet. XXIII fer. III post Invocavit&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Thomas, called Barak, confessed that when three from Raborsch went to Brod, he went with them and stole a fish weir from the fisherman Plavsky, eating all the fish at Klima's in Horka. They would not let the host leave to report them. Then they beat a carter from Kosteletz and stole three ells of cloth from him, which they dyed, made into clothes and sold the rest to Nohejl in Aujezd. He also confessed that they went on raids to Brod and divided the spoils at Horka, where they all benefited and received their share from each raid.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;IV: Pavuchek from the Mill&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
He admitted buying whatever came to him without asking about its origin and even picking locks on chests himself. In Suchdol, he took cushions, sheets and seven good pillows, removed the feathers, sold them, and handed over the fabrics in Kuttenberg as payment for a debt to the innkeeper Beikovetz. Dushko, the forester's son, often visited him and sold him axes, wedges and ropes stolen from woodcutters in the forest. He led two maidservants from Mesoles to Devil’s Den, where he sold them, which they reportedly did willingly, but they had little benefit from it, so they complained about Pavuchek, and he beat them until they could not walk.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;V: In Mesoles&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Martin, the steward from Pernstein, confessed that he secretly captured people with his henchmen to prevent them from going to market in Kuttenberg. He did this under the commission of Sir Butzek, and they made six thousand groschen. He then divided this among his men who joined him on the raids. The steward also confessed that they frequently targeted the Miskowitz estate, from where they took horses and other livestock. In Mesoles, they stole a good horse, a sword and five cheeses from Knight Havel's yard, beat him severely, and subsequently set the barn on fire to prevent his hands from pursuing them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;inc&gt;T&lt;/inc&gt;his is a copy of the ninth volume of the confessions of captured wicked persons, who thus spoke under torture to the bailiff or during interrogation before the Kuttenberg city court.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;I: The Year Ninety-Eight&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Vashek, the shepherd from Sukov, son of Milota, carpenter from Grund, confessed under torture that he stole a skirt and a belt with a bag in Kuttenberg. He then confessed that he went stealing rye and geese with Petr Maly from Sedletz from a farmer in Pschitok. He stole a good coat, boots and a shirt from the farmer Petr Kuklik. He lost all of it gambling in Kuttenberg, and the local innkeeper paid him eight groschen for it, even though the neighbour Vanyek told her the coat was stolen. The innkeeper replied, "Stolen or not, that's fine"
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;II: The Confession of Jira the Thrice Wicked&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Jira, called Shourek, confessed that he killed a townsman from Brod on the road near Wysoka, taking from him three score of groschen, clothes and a good horse. He further confessed to killing a certain Nicholas on the Kolin road and also a German, who tried to harm him with his testimony. Then, along with three accomplices, Matthew from Krzesetitz, a certain Jakubek from Maleshov and Martin Dlouhy from Rabstein, they attacked the bailiff in Bylany because he discovered their theft of thirty horses. Finally, he confessed that they all frequented Rabstein and sent the miller under Cimburk to sell the goods.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;III: Anno et cet. XXIII fer. III post Invocavit&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Thomas, called Barak, confessed that when three from Raborsch went to Brod, he went with them and stole a fish weir from the fisherman Plavsky, eating all the fish at Klima's in Horka. They would not let the host leave to report them. Then they beat a carter from Kosteletz and stole three ells of cloth from him, which they dyed, made into clothes and sold the rest to Nohejl in Aujezd. He also confessed that they went on raids to Brod and divided the spoils at Horka, where they all benefited and received their share from each raid.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;IV: Pavuchek from the Mill&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
He admitted buying whatever came to him without asking about its origin and even picking locks on chests himself. In Suchdol, he took cushions, sheets and seven good pillows, removed the feathers, sold them, and handed over the fabrics in Kuttenberg as payment for a debt to the innkeeper Beikovetz. Dushko, the forester's son, often visited him and sold him axes, wedges and ropes stolen from woodcutters in the forest. He led two maidservants from Mesoles to Devil’s Den, where he sold them, which they reportedly did willingly, but they had little benefit from it, so they complained about Pavuchek, and he beat them until they could not walk.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;V: In Mesoles&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Martin, the steward from Pernstein, confessed that he secretly captured people with his henchmen to prevent them from going to market in Kuttenberg. He did this under the commission of Sir Butzek, and they made six thousand groschen. He then divided this among his men who joined him on the raids. The steward also confessed that they frequently targeted the Miskowitz estate, from where they took horses and other livestock. In Mesoles, they stole a good horse, a sword and five cheeses from Knight Havel's yard, beat him severely, and subsequently set the barn on fire to prevent his hands from pursuing them.

&lt;heading&gt;II: Felonies of Robbery&lt;/heading&gt;

<Row><Cell>kuttenberglorebook_knihat_xSwL</Cell><Cell>&lt;inc&gt;T&lt;/inc&gt;his is the second volume with a list of Kuttenberg city markets and the regulations related to them.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;I: City Markets and Fairs&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
The largest market in Kuttenberg is the Grain Market, followed by the Lower Market, also called Underlak. Here, meat from cattle and pigs is sold. The third in line is the Upper Market, which opens on the upper side to the wide Merchant Street. There, from the west, you can find smaller markets: the Charcoal Market, Beer Market, Pottery Market, Lead Market, and finally the Salt Market. Further along, there is the large Horse Market, known as Rossmarkt, located under the Gurein Gate. Lastly, in the Lower Town at Hoprink, there is a large charcoal and ore market where traders and miners have long negotiated the price of silver.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;II: City Weights&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
Kuttenberg places great importance on upholding royal law and order. Therefore, anyone can freely verify that they have not been given short weight for the meat sold or mismeasured cloth. For this purpose, there are stamped weights and iron yardsticks in the hall on the ground floor of the town hall. If anyone finds negligence or malintent, they can immediately report the finding to an official, who will promptly rectify the situation in the market.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;III: City Gates and Customs&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;
During the reign of the Luxembourg kings, the Upper Town acquired stone walls, and subsequently, a ring of stone and lime also enclosed the Lower Town. Many additional gates and small gates were added to the original four main gates. First, to the west is the Gurein Gate, followed by the Časlau Gate to the north, the Bohemian Gate, and the Klösterle Gate facing Sedletz. To the south is the solitary Hrádek Gate and the newest, the grand eastern Časlau Gate. Each gate has its own guild-paid guard, which oversees order and the collection of customs. Under the penalty of losing their goods, merchants are prohibited from entering the city through other gates.

&lt;paragraph&gt;Finally, I order that the watchmen go on patrol in full armour, and be paid double wages for their watch, and special rewards for capturing criminals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Once upon a time, there lived in Greek Iolkos a usurper &lt;accent&gt;Pelias&lt;/accent&gt;, who seized power, dethroned the rightful heir, and did not recognise the claims of his son &lt;accent&gt;Jason&lt;/accent&gt;. When Jason came to him as the prophecy said, wearing only one sandal, Pelias recognised that he was the one who would kill him. Therefore, he set a condition for relinquishing his power, which was the golden ram's fleece from Colchis across the eastern sea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Jason had a large, sturdy ship built for himself with fifty oars, such as had never been seen before, and he named it &lt;accent&gt;Argó&lt;/accent&gt;. For his crew, he chose only the most excellent men, including the strongmen Heracles and Castor, the kings Meleager and Telamon, the legendary singer Orpheus, the ship's doctor Asclepius, the seer Idmon, the helmsman Tiphys, and many other renowned heroes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;O&lt;/inc&gt;n their long voyage, they encountered many dangers from gods, giants, and sea monsters, and fought many battles, where the heads of tyrants of barbarian realms from the dawn of time, when gods still walked among men, fell.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;When the ship anchored in &lt;accent&gt;Colchis&lt;/accent&gt;, the local king &lt;accent&gt;Aeëtes&lt;/accent&gt; promised Jason the golden fleece in exchange for a very difficult task. He had to plough a field with wild bulls with metal hooves, sow it with dragon's teeth, and slay the undead soldiers that would arise from them by evening. With the help of his friends and the beautiful king's daughter &lt;accent&gt;Medea&lt;/accent&gt;, Jason accomplished all this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Aeëtes, however, was treacherous, so Jason had to steal the fleece and fled to the sea with &lt;accent&gt;Medea&lt;/accent&gt;. The Colchians pursued him, but he managed to escape, though he lost many of his comrades in the process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;U&lt;/inc&gt;pon returning to Iolkos, Jason presented King Pelias with the golden fleece, but Pelias still refused to give up the throne. Then Jason hardened his heart and, with the sorceress Medea, poisoned his rival. However, this act did not pay off well for them. Medea lost her love for Jason, and he became an outcast on his ship Argó until the ship itself brought about his end.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;B&lt;/inc&gt;eginning with you, &lt;accent&gt;Phoebe&lt;/accent&gt;, I will recount the famous deeds of ancient men, who, at the command of King &lt;accent&gt;Pelius&lt;/accent&gt;, sailed through the mouth of the Pontus with their ship Argo, to find the golden fleece and perform many heroic deeds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Medea lost her love for Jason, and he became an outcast on his ship Argó until the ship itself brought about his end.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

He rejected his first-born daughter, and ordered the child to be thrown in the forest. The child, however, was discovered by a she-bear, who let them drink her milk, and so saved them from certain death. Later, hunters took the girl, named her Atalanta, and taught her their art. Soon she grew into a sturdy, strong woman who surpassed men in hunting, running and riding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Because of this, the virgin goddess of the hunt, Artemis, took a liking to her, and Atalanta took a vow of chastity after her example. She sailed with the Argonauts on their expeditions and was one of the hunters who set out to hunt the Calydonian boar. It was her arrow that first struck the creature. Meleagros, the son of the Calydonian king who eventually managed to kill the beast, gave Atalanta the boar's hide in exchange for a promise of her love. He was killed, however, and the marriage never took place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Atalanta soon gained fame and glory that reached all the way back to her father. On their reunion, he demanded that his daughter marry despite her vows. She agreed, but set a condition - she would marry only such a man who would surpass her in running. Many men entered the race, and many took the ignominious loss. Only finally did Hippomenes appear, and he managed to defeat Atalanta (albeit by trickery).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The story of Atalanta has two known endings. In one, she married Hippomenes and was his equal as hunter, wife and companion.

You'll drown in sorrow, I promise you!” &lt;br/&gt;
The devious fox ran with a yell &lt;br/&gt;
And dragged the pitcher to a well. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</Cell><Cell>“It's a pitcher that I found,” she answered, &lt;br/&gt;
Which will surely please my master. &lt;br/&gt;
At the top of a hill the jug weighed her down, &lt;br/&gt;
So she dropped it on the ground. &lt;br/&gt;
She said, “Good sir, now if you will, &lt;br/&gt;
I'd like you to roll down the hill. &lt;br/&gt;
Don't take it ill, dear man of clay, &lt;br/&gt;
But you're too heavy to carry all day.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

Down the hill the pitcher charged, &lt;br/&gt;
The fox ran after, panting hard: &lt;br/&gt;
“Pitcher, must you run so fast? &lt;br/&gt;
My heart will burst inside my chest! &lt;br/&gt;
The jug reached the bottom and came to a halt. &lt;br/&gt;
No more could he roll; it wasn't his fault. &lt;br/&gt;
“Come now, sir!” the fox did scold, &lt;br/&gt;
Only halfway have you rolled! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

It seems you don't want to go with me, &lt;br/&gt;
Well, like it or not, you will, you'll see! &lt;br/&gt;
Jug, you'll stick with me forever; &lt;br/&gt;
From now on we will not be severed!” &lt;br/&gt;
So saying, she tied it to her tail: &lt;br/&gt;
“Now, pitcher, come with me you shall! &lt;br/&gt;
In your own juice you soon will stew, &lt;br/&gt;
You'll drown in sorrow, I promise you!” &lt;br/&gt;

After thirty days of truce, both armies were once again preparing for battle. On the night before the battle, &lt;accent&gt;Andromeda&lt;/accent&gt;, Hector's wife, had a terrible vision that her husband would not escape death the next day. In the dark of the night, she immediately revealed everything to her husband and begged him not to go into battle, but Hector harshly rebuked her, saying that it was not fitting for warriors to flee from the fight because of deceptive dreams.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Andromeda ran to the king and queen to implore them to forbid their son from going into battle, warning that they would surely be burying him if they did not. They all knelt before Hector, pleading with him in tears, but he ignored them and prepared for battle. He mounted his horse and rode out before the assembled Trojan army.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Then began the terrible battle between the Achaeans and the Trojans, with countless men attacking each other so fiercely that a thousand died on the spot before the ranks even clashed. Amid the calls of horns and the sounds of pipes, the Greek king &lt;accent&gt;Menelaus&lt;/accent&gt; struck hard at the Syrian allies, but the Trojans did not let them fall, and the battle raged fiercely where it had previously calmed. There fought &lt;accent&gt;Troilus&lt;/accent&gt;, there his rival King &lt;accent&gt;Telamon&lt;/accent&gt;, and elsewhere &lt;accent&gt;Achilles&lt;/accent&gt; and his Myrmidons were pushing the Trojans back toward the city. So many heroic deeds were performed in such a short time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;A&lt;/inc&gt;chilles planned to capture the Trojan prince &lt;accent&gt;Margaretis&lt;/accent&gt;, but killed him in the battle. When Prince Hector saw this, he immediately launched an attack with his men, killing many Greek nobles. Achilles quickly realised that fortune was turning against the Achaeans and would not allow them to triumph over the Trojans. But then &lt;accent&gt;Polices&lt;/accent&gt;, the betrothed of Achilles' sister, arrived on the battlefield with his men and attacked Hector, who killed him. Thus, the two princes finally faced each other in battle, seeking vengeance for their fallen comrades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Achilles first attacked Hector, but Hector wounded him in the thigh with a spear, forcing his enemy to withdraw from the fight to have his wound bandaged. Later, as Achilles was searching for his foe, he saw that Hector had captured a Greek lord and was therefore without a shield. He spurred his horse and struck Hector so hard in the chest that the prince fell dead on the spot. The loyal companion &lt;accent&gt;Odemon&lt;/accent&gt;, seeing Hector's death, immediately knocked Achilles from his horse with a spear, making everyone believe he was dead, and they carried him from the field.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;W&lt;/inc&gt;hen the Trojans saw their greatest and bravest among them fall, they ended the battle and, with great weeping, lamentation, and grief that cannot be described or expressed, carried his dead body back to their city.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;T&lt;/inc&gt;hus begins the story of the killing of the heroic &lt;accent&gt;Hector&lt;/accent&gt;, the Trojan prince, which occurred in the tenth year of the war between the Achaeans and the defenders of the city of Troy.

&lt;paragraph&gt;Achilles first attacked Hector, but Hector wounded him in the thigh with a spear, forcing his enemy to withdraw from the fight to have his wound bandaged. Later, as Achilles was searching for his foe, he saw that Hector had captured a Greek lord and was therefore without a shield. He spurred his horse and struck Hector so hard in the chest that the prince fell dead on the spot. The loyal companion &lt;accent&gt;Odemon&lt;/accent&gt;, seeing Hector's death, immediately knocked Achilles from his horse with a spear, making everyone believe he was dead, and they carried him from the field.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;W&lt;/inc&gt;hen the Trojans saw their greatest and bravest among them fall, they ended the battle and, with great weeping, lamentation, and grief that cannot be described or expressed, carried his dead body back to their city.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

Before the waning of the first millennium, two empires did exist here side by side—the Great Moravian Empire and the disunited Duchy of Bohemia, in which the Přemylid dynasty did reign supreme and Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the land, did hail from this lineage, as did his brother Boleslaus I, who solidified power and unified the land.&lt;br/&gt;His son, Boleslaus II, did promote the parish of Prague into the Diocese of Prague, and thus the land did join the Holy Roman Empire, although no ruler of the Přemyslid lineage had yet received the title of king. The first to do so was Vratislaus II, who in the year of our Lord 1086, for coming to the aid of the emperor during the attack on Milan, did earn himself the crown, but his progeny did not have such fortune until Ottakar defended his inherited right to the crown.&lt;br/&gt; It would have been natural for him to then occupy the neighbouring land of Moravia, but he did not, for he wisely and peacefully charged his son with administering this land and thus did make of Moravia a March, which later became not an imperial fiefdom but a royal fiefdom, belonging to the Bohemian Crown.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

But the Přemyslids were not meant to rule for long, for a murderer's hand did intervene and this great dynasty was slayed by the sword and the empty throne did then fall to the Luxembourgs, who did annex to this country other territories of great size, so that the Kingdom of Bohemia nearly stretched from sea to sea. The most famed of kings of Bohemia, and the King of the Romans in the same man, was Charles IV of Luxembourg, who did establish great wealth and bounty for the entire land and its fame did spread, for he did promote the diocese to an archdiocese and did command for a great University at Prague to be built and a New Town with a stone bridge to connect it to the Old. The University at Prague did become the home of many a learned man and Prague did become the Seat of the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;Charles's firstborn son, Wenceslas III, was bequeathed a land of great riches and prosperity by his father, but he did devote himself more to whores and drink than to wise rule. He did set his own bishops against Rome and against each other and his incompetence as a ruler was so great that his own brother, who had inherited the ways of a ruler from his father, had him taken prisoner and dethroned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;accent&gt;A note: What has been written here about the good King Wenceslas is a blatant lie. Sigismund, that Ginger Fox, is the son of a whore and traitor to his land!

These seven nearby planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon. Furthermore, we must be able to calculate the ascendant of each sign to determine their greatest strength. Regarding the magical patterns of constellations and their documented direct effects, I will provide several examples here and many more in the following chapters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;heading&gt;Talisman for Repelling Mice&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The pattern involves the planets of the sign &lt;accent&gt;Leo&lt;/accent&gt;. Draw this pattern in a red metal bowl during the first phase of the constellation of Leo. Then place the bowl where the mouse is, and it will flee and not return as long as the pattern is drawn there. The pattern is:&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;If you want to sow enmity between two people, draw this pattern in a black metal bowl along with a black dog’s fang. Do this on the day and hour dedicated to &lt;accent&gt;Saturn&lt;/accent&gt;, when it is at the peak of its power and its ascendant is in the third phase of the sign &lt;accent&gt;Capricorn&lt;/accent&gt;.

&lt;paragraph&gt;On the Ethiopian coast, where sharp rocks jut out and waves crash against the shore, the youth &lt;accent&gt;Perseus&lt;/accent&gt; killed the terrible monster Ceto, which Poseidon had sent for Princess &lt;accent&gt;Andromeda&lt;/accent&gt;, and turned her to stone. Near the city of Joppa, he first wounded her with his sword and then turned her to stone. For this brave deed, he immediately married the princess, and when a cow was sacrificed to Minerva, Hermes received a calf, and a bull was offered to Zeus. King Cepheus asked the brave young man how he had accomplished all this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;After partaking of the exquisite dishes, Perseus finally spoke of his journey beyond the cold Ocean for the head of Medusa. He told of a safe place beyond the sea, where in the rocks the three Gorgons, daughters of Phorcys, dreadful witches, had their abode. Only &lt;accent&gt;Medusa&lt;/accent&gt; among them was mortal, but her gaze was so terrifying that it turned anyone who looked at her to stone. Many such unfortunate souls stood there as stones along the hidden paths for eternity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;And then, before the Ethiopian king, Perseus recalled how the goddess &lt;accent&gt;Pallas Athena&lt;/accent&gt; had given him a magical sickle, a helmet, and wise advice to look at Medusa’s face only through its reflection on his shield to evade her dreadful curse. Moreover, wearing his magical helmet, he was invisible to the Gorgon, so she searched for him in vain, trying to kill him by sound alone. Perseus quickly beheaded her from an ambush, took her head, and escaped the remaining two immortal sisters on Hermes' winged sandals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;At the feast, a nobleman asked the young man why the monster had venomous snakes woven into her hair. To this, Perseus replied that he had heard that the Gorgon was originally a fair maiden with beautiful hair, but she shamefully sinned with the god &lt;accent&gt;Neptune&lt;/accent&gt; in Minerva's temple, and thus the scorned goddess turned her hair into snakes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;inc&gt;T&lt;/inc&gt;hus begins the tale of Medusa, daughter of the sea god Phorcys, who was transformed by the goddess Minerva for her pride.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Hear you, ragged ones! &lt;br/&gt;
Evil times are on us&lt;br/&gt;
And of clothing none! &lt;br/&gt;
Evil winds blow, &lt;br/&gt;
Evil is sown! &lt;br/&gt;
Blasts of bitter weather, &lt;br/&gt;
One upon another, &lt;br/&gt;
Bringing nought but bother&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Heavy falls the snow, &lt;br/&gt;
Foretelling great woe! &lt;br/&gt;
Worn threadbare your cloak, &lt;br/&gt;
Hose torn and shoes are broke. &lt;br/&gt;
We sleep through summer&lt;br/&gt;
Heedless in slumber&lt;br/&gt;
Of next winter's snows. &lt;br/&gt;
How great our woes, &lt;br/&gt;
How poor our clothes!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ye poor, be of good cheer, &lt;br/&gt;
Joy is with us here! &lt;br/&gt;
Clothes worn away, &lt;br/&gt;
Heads turned to grey! &lt;br/&gt;
Despair, poor ones, &lt;br/&gt;
Shall guide us on, &lt;br/&gt;
What can we endeavour? &lt;br/&gt;
Our path forever&lt;br/&gt;
To seek God's favour.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Caps from our heads torn, &lt;br/&gt;
None is left to keep. &lt;br/&gt;
What grief we have sown&lt;br/&gt;
So shall we yet reap! &lt;br/&gt;
Sheaves cut short&lt;br/&gt;
And sad of heart. &lt;br/&gt;

Together with other noble maidens she founded the Convent of the Poor Virgins of St. Clare and became its first abbess. Here she cared for the poor and the sick and, as a daughter of the king, sought to right wrongs, always protecting the poor from the strong and powerful.

The flames quickly consumed the entire church, the hospital and the Order's library containing thousands of precious manuscripts and holy relics. Many of the sick and the brothers who had thrown themselves into the fire for them were burned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The terrible loss was all the greater because the land books and records also disappeared. It was very well contrived. For the new pope, Urban VI, did not look kindly on rich monasteries and rebellious orders, and gave his bishops free rein to intrigue.

His successor was elected Zdeněk, who, however, more than concerned with the reformation of things, was on the contrary more concerned with intrigue, and conspired with the Prague chapter against the archbishop, so that truth and unity came to a great detriment.

Anebo bezuzdnými tělesnými radovánkami, neuspořádaným životem a hojným a silným pitím.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;
Ve studeném a vlhkém čase ležíe v málo vytopené místnosti. Dávejte vonné věci do krbu, jako jsou pryskyřice, zrna javolce anebo kadidlo.&lt;br/&gt;
Ale nade všechno působí hněvivně záchvaty: samotný hněv způsobuje dnu i bolesti hlavy, jak praví Aristotelés: &lt;accent&gt;Hněv je příval krve k srdci...&lt;/accent&gt;, pročež přivádí a způsobuje paralýzu, to jest dnu. Chraňte se tedy před hněvem, protože hvěvivé záchvaty zabraňují duši, aby nemohla spatřit pravdu. A pozor: protože samotný hněv udělá z člověka šílence. A protože u vás dochází k paralýze ze semene mysli, o to více kroťte pomocí obveselu jiných věcí ap.&lt;br/&gt;
Pamatujte: hodně soli a pepře, málo pití (vína) a zdravá životospráva v jídle i pití vám prospívají. A bujné tělesné radovánky jen zřídka a ne v jinou dobu než po prvním spánku.&lt;br/&gt;
A vše, čeho je příliš, se zvrátí v neřest. Vězte, že starosti způsobují šedivění a předčasný úpadek lidských sil. Ale to - já Albík - nevím: kde se v těch dobách prodává dobrá mysl a útěcha. A tolik prozatím stačí.&lt;br/&gt;

<Row><Cell>rozinakniha_cleverparson__lz4a</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;About the clever parson&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;One priest in Prague didn't like the fact that his parishioners didn't want to buy indulgences. The treasury in the church was empty, but some really wealthy people were coming to confession, and the priest knew they had something to confess. So one day, as the people were gathering to leave after Mass, he announced, so that everyone could hear: &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Good people! Believe me, I am very reluctant to do this, but I must. Hear that there is a man among us who is having a sinful affair with his neighbor's wife. Remember the sixth commandment - thou shalt not commit adultery! - and listen to me well. If there are not at least one hundred and twenty groschen in the treasury by tomorrow evening, I will publicly proclaim who the sinner is among us."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The parishioners dispersed to their homes, whispering excitedly among themselves as to whom the parson could possibly be talking about. The latter only smiled under his beard, looking forward to seeing how he would succeed with his threat. When he opened the treasury the next evening, he found not one hundred and twenty, but the whole three hundred groschen, and a small folded note with the following message:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Have mercy, father, and give me one more day. I'll get the other sixty somewhere!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;As many, and men in particular, will gladly testify, of the two generations, it is the female that is imperfect, prone to all manner of sins and faults. It is an old known truth that the testimony of many is a credible testimony, the truth of which cannot be doubted. But who hath appointed the woman her lot? God? Or man? Who has decreed that woman is incapable of thinking, acting and deciding without the guidance of man?
&lt;paragraph&gt;By whom was it determined that women were too foolish and vice-ridden to participate in matters wholly male - politics, science, or the liberal arts? Is such a resolution supported by experience or evidence? After all, no one has ever given a woman the opportunity to demonstrate the necessary judgment and wit.

&lt;paragraph&gt;A man who accuses a woman of vice has squandered his own youth in licentiousness. In old age, these men recall with regret the sins of their past life without ever repenting of them.

&lt;paragraph&gt;Not so long ago, a young seamstress used to have her own shop in Kutná Hora. A young nobleman regularly had his clothes made by her. He was always kind, brought her gifts, spared no praise and the seamstress liked him. Once he asked her to make him a coat and trousers in which he could propose to his beloved. The seamstress got all flushed and asked if he knew the girl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;He smiled and said he didn't, but if she made the dress, he would surely know her soon. The seamstress cheered inwardly and promised that the dress would be ready in three days. She chose the best cloth, worked day and night, and took care of every stitch. When on the third day the nobleman came to collect the finished dress, she was as good as new.
&lt;paragraph&gt;"You have golden hands," the young man complimented her. "I will go at once to my sweetheart and ask for her hand! When she says yes, I'll bring her here to make her a dress for her wedding!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The seamstress recognized that the nobleman had taken advantage of her, and she felt like crying. But she made no sign of it, and as she helped the young man out of his coat, she tore one of the sleeves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Oh, I am clumsy!" She apologized. "You can't stand up for your sweetheart like that! Give me another day and I'll fix the coat!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The young man didn't want to wait any longer, but he agreed rather than ask the lady for her hand in a torn dress. The seamstress had ripped out all the seams overnight and sewn in fleas she had picked up from a stray dog. She finished the job by pouring several generous handfuls of salt into the folds of fabric.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The next morning, the nobleman picked up the dress and immediately rushed to his mistress in it. Soon, however, fleas came out of the seams and began to bite him. The young man scratched and clawed, but only rubbed the pungent salt into the fresh bites. He wriggled, jumped, stumbled about, and before he reached his sweetheart's house the whole town was laughing at him.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

<Row><Cell>rozinakniha_eloquentdame__b5Jc</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;About a loquacious lady and a bad dancer&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;It is known that anyone can point out someone's shortcomings and bring shame upon them. But few can point out someone's faults in such a way that the unfortunate person notices them without causing public ridicule.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;I will tell you of a lady who mastered this art. She was not only clever and quick in speech, but also young and beautiful to look at. When she appeared in society, men flocked to her. The young men asked her to dance and offered their arms, the older ones asked for her hand in marriage and offered what little the old men could still give to the young lady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Suddenly a young man asked her to dance. He had a handsome face and fine manners, so the lady accepted his proposal. After a few steps, however, she realized that she had made a big mistake. The dancer seemed to have two left feet. He stumbled, tripped, almost fell several times, and despite his apologies, the lady found dancing with him a torture. The other dancers noticed this, and began to whisper and point in their direction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Any other would have embarrassed him with indiscriminate words. She might even have sued the other ladies to watch out for the losers. Not the lady in my story. What does it matter if he's a bad dancer? she said to herself. Others may dance with ease, but they also drink with it, indulge in dice and light girls. Better a bad dancer than a good drinker.
&lt;paragraph&gt;So she smiled and said out loud for all to hear, "Young sir, how I would love to keep dancing with you. But I wore the wrong shoes today. They're pushing me so hard that I can't go on. Please escort me out into the fresh air."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Her dancer quickly understood what she meant by that remark and hurriedly walked with her to the door. Everyone present thought that perhaps she was going to give him a hard time at the door, or give him a well-deserved slap. The lady and her dancer, however, did not return to the entertainment that evening.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;As many, and men in particular, will gladly testify, of the two generations, it is the female that is imperfect, prone to all manner of sins and faults. It is an old known truth that the testimony of many is a credible testimony, the truth of which cannot be doubted. But who hath appointed the woman her lot? God? Or man? Who has decreed that woman is incapable of thinking, acting and deciding without the guidance of man?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;By whom was it determined that women were too foolish and vice-ridden to participate in matters wholly male - politics, science, or the liberal arts? Is such a resolution supported by experience or evidence? After all, no one has ever given a woman the opportunity to demonstrate the necessary judgment and wit. We have only conveniently condemned it as inadequate, and have made this judgment an established truth which no one dares to question. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;We have witnessed many injuries to the daughters of Eve, and therefore may, or rather must, testify that the world is unjustly ordered in this respect. Men are fond of exalting themselves above women and attributing all sorts of wrongs to them, but only to cover their own faults!&lt;/paragraph&gt;

<Row><Cell>rozinakniha_girlwithgolde_apDr</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;About a black-eyed girl&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Once upon a time there was a poor girl. Black-eyed and black-haired, the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood, though she wore poor clothes and lived in a shack by the woods. The girls shunned her because they envied her beauty, but she made nothing of them. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;There was a miller in the village who thought of marrying her. He tried to flatter her with sweet words and told her what she would have if she became his wife. But she would not listen to his words. Soon word spread in the village that the miller was going to see her, and the rest of the girls became jealous. They came to the miller and each tried to tell him something bad about the black-eyed woman. She's a savage, a witch, the daughter of a urchin...
&lt;paragraph&gt;The miller pretended to listen attentively, but subtly took something from each of them. One an embroidered ribbon, another a silver ring, the third a silk scarf. Then he hurried to the woods and gave the stolen items to the girl as a gift. He hoped to win her over and make her his wife at last. The black-eyed girl gratefully accepted the gifts, but when he proposed again, she again refused. The miller became angry, took her by the hand and dragged her to the stream where the other girls were washing clothes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"I'm bringing you a thief! Look what she took from you! Your scarf, your ribbon, even your ring!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Each of them recognized some of her belongings and in a fit of rage, they killed the black-eyed girl. When they realized what they had done, they begged the miller to help them. He promised to say nothing and buried the girl's body under a dead hazel bush. Because she lived away from the village, no one looked for her for a long time, and the miller thought that everything would be forgotten. In the spring, however, the hazel bush turned green and new twigs grew on it. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;When they grew stronger, the local shepherds made whistles out of them. But when they wanted to play, the whistles complained:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Black eyes, white bones,&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;Lies in the grave of a sweet girl.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;The miller stole, the miller lied,&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;and buried her here himself...&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;And so the young miller was betrayed and executed within a year of his crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;In a distant land, there lived a young prince who, during one of his hunting trips into the forest, heard a girl's voice, singing so beautifully that the songbirds ruffled their feathers in envy. The prince followed the voice and thought to himself, "When I find this singing maiden, I will take her with me and marry her. Everyone will envy me, because my wife will sing more beautifully than a nightingale!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;He walked and walked until he came to a clearing where an old, tall willow tree stood. In its crown sat a lovely maiden, singing so beautifully that even the wind in the branches fell silent. The prince set aside his crossbow, so as not to frighten the girl, and called out:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Beautiful maiden, I am the prince of this kingdom, and I ask for your hand! Be my wife and live as a queen!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"I cannot be your wife," she replied. "I am not allowed to leave here. But if you care for me, come again tomorrow."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The prince was unwilling to give up the girl, and the next day he set out to see her again. He brought with him a magnificent golden ring.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Come with me, beautiful maiden. I will love you forever, and you will want for nothing!" he pleaded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"I’ve already told you that I cannot," she repeated. "But if you care for me, you will come again tomorrow."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The third time, the prince brought the girl a dress made from the finest silk. She liked it, but again repeated that she could not marry him, even so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;And so the young prince went to the willow a fourth time, bringing with him a trio of woodcutters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"You will finally be my wife!" he said, and ordered the tree to be cut down.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The maiden wept and begged in vain. The tree soon fell to the ground, and the prince thought he had won. But as soon as her foot touched the moss-covered earth, the girl turned into a small nightingale and instantly disappeared into the shadows of the forest. Love cannot be taken by force, and whoever tries will soon lose it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;subtitle&gt;A. von Wallenstein and Raimund R. Hardt on men and women&lt;/subtitle&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;As many, and men in particular, will gladly testify, of the two generations, it is the female that is imperfect, prone to all manner of sins and faults. It is an old known truth that the testimony of many is a credible testimony, the truth of which cannot be doubted. But who hath appointed the woman her lot? God? Or man? Who has decreed that woman is incapable of thinking, acting and deciding without the guidance of man?
&lt;paragraph&gt;By whom was it determined that women were too foolish and vice-ridden to participate in matters wholly male - politics, science, or the liberal arts? Is such a resolution supported by experience or evidence? After all, no one has ever given a woman the opportunity to demonstrate the necessary judgment and wit. We have only conveniently condemned it as inadequate, and have made this judgment an established truth which no one dares to question. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;We have witnessed many injuries to the daughters of Eve, and therefore we may, or rather must, testify that the world is unjustly ordered in this respect. Men are fond of exalting themselves above women and attributing all sorts of wrongs to them, but only to cover their own faults!&lt;/paragraph&gt;

<Row><Cell>rozinakniha_miserlytownsm_kfED</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;About the miserly townsman&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Rich doesn't necessarily make a person bad. While there are rich people who are greedy and selfish, they are certainly not all like that. The townsman our story is about, however, is one of the richest and most miserly who ever lived. But his name was also Hermann Knauser!
&lt;paragraph&gt;Knauser was renowned in the town for his wealth, but his avarice was the talk of the region. He had the most beautiful house in the best quarter and liked to invite visitors who admired its decoration. When it came to entertaining, however, he gave them dry bread, lest they should eat of the delicacies he kept for himself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;One day, a painter who had formerly also stayed at the royal court came to town. So to have him paint something for me would surely be the envy of all! thought Mr. Knauser, and the next day he invited the master to his house. He took him through the rooms, showing him the costly furniture, fabrics, and statuettes with which they were decorated. The painter watched everything, but said nothing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Finally, Mr. Knauser told him:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Master, you see that my house contains the best of all kinds of art. I have seen the works of various artists, and few things can surprise me yet, let alone make me pay for it. What do you think, master, can you paint something like this?"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The master, who had long ago guessed Knauser's character, shook his head and replied:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"I'm sure he did. I'll show you something that will make your head spin. But I'll need plenty of time, and I can't bear for the client to see the work unfinished. If you really want my painting, go away for a week, let me work in peace, and when you come back, I promise you will find a work like you've never seen before."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Knauser didn't want to host the master for a week, but finally agreed and left. Instead of painting for a week, the master was accosted by his servants, gradually drinking the wine cellar and raiding the pantry. It was not until just before his departure that he picked up his brushes and paints.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;When the master returned seven days later, he found the house empty, eaten to the last crumb. Knauser ran to the room where the master was to paint his picture on the wall. There he found a hastily painted fat roast pig on a golden tray, with a golden apple between its lips.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

It was not until just before his departure that he picked up his brushes and paints.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;When Knauser returned seven days later, he found the house empty of stocks, eaten to the last crumb. He ran to the room where the master was to paint his picture on the wall. There he found a hastily painted fat roast pig on a golden platter, with a golden apple in its jaws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;paragraph&gt;Once upon a time there was a man in Kutná Hora who was considered the biggest miser in town. He never dropped a coin to beggars or street hustlers, he never went to taverns or bathhouses. Even when he walked down the street with a lantern and someone wanted to burn a candle from him, he would not share lest he accidentally run out of light. Even thieves avoided his house because there was nothing to take.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;His servants had to work for a pittance, and were given hard bread and half a tankard of beer with their meals. But even that was not enough for the miser. He pondered and pondered until he figured out a way to keep all his servants hungry for at least one day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;He consulted the apothecary, and in the morning, at the time he usually rose, his servants discovered him lying on his bed, pale, cold, as if dead. None of them suspected that their master was actually alive and hearing their every word. They washed his body and wrapped him in a shroud, as was proper. But then they began to rejoice and rejoice loudly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;When, instead of mourning and fasting, the servants opened the larders and chambers, rolled out the casks of wine and began to feast, the false dead man decided to put a stop to their celebrations. He arose from his bed, and, still in the shroud of death, ran among them. But before he could say anything, one of his servants, by this time quite drunk, cried out, "Ghost!" and took him over the head with a jug. The master was dead on the spot, but it was three days and three nights before anyone called for a priest.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

But we say that a man who has a wife who is sensible and wise, and refuses to listen to her, is twice as foolish!&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

&lt;paragraph&gt;Once upon a time there was a cook. His name was Witzbold, and one afternoon he was preparing his master a heron for dinner. The bird was already roasted, and the cook was just cutting fresh bread to nibble on, when a little girl he was very fond of came into the kitchen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Witzbold, what a smell!" she gushed. "That you'd give me a leg..."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"I'm not giving you anything!" he protested. "That's a heron for our master!"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"If you're so stingy, I'll be there tonight!" The maid retorted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The cook was mollified, gave the girl a heron's leg, and hurried to the dining hall with the rest of the roast. But the master immediately noticed that the bird was missing one leg. Witzbold called back and demanded an explanation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"My lord, herons have just one leg. And therefore one leg," Witzbold replied seriously.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"What are you saying, cook? Do you take me for a fool?" the master fumed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"It is as I say, sir. If you want to see for yourself, I'll show you for yourself," the cook boasted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The gentleman, convinced that the cook was lying, agreed. The next morning they went together to the pond, where a whole flock of herons were sleeping by the banks. Their heads were tucked under their wings and they were actually standing on one leg.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"So you see, sir, a bird is a leg," the cook pointed triumphantly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The gentleman, however, did not accept defeat. He put his hands to his mouth and exclaimed: "Shoo!" until all the herons flew to the sky. Clearly they both saw that they had two legs, like any other bird.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Well, chef? Are you still going to tell me they only have one leg?" frowned the master.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Oh no, sir," Witzbold defended himself. "But you didn't shout 'shoo' at dinner last night either. Had you done so, surely the other leg would have grown on the roast."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;It served the Lord's honor that he laughed heartily instead of thinking of punishment. Witzbold appreciated it and never again presented him with an incomplete dinner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

<Row><Cell>rozinakniha_remarriedwido_IxcN</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;A widower who remarried&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Once upon a time there was a rich old burgher in Kutná Hora. He had been widowed long ago, but he was not so old that he wanted to live alone. So he married a maid who served him. She was a simple, poor girl, but prettier than any noblewoman and twice as clever. But the old widower did not know that. It was enough for him to enjoy the sight of his wife during the day, and once in a while to enjoy her in the evening. He had no idea that the girl had eyes for his young groom more than for him.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;So when her husband did not want to enjoy her in the evening, she hurried to the stables to see the groom who slept there. One day, however, she forgot that her husband had an important journey early in the morning. What a surprise it was to both husbands when the master entered the stable at dawn. Instead of a horse, he found a saddled groom and his own wife in the saddle. What a scream! The husband had put her on to the harlots and was about to go to the town crier to get justice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;His wife, however, did not just give in. She stood in his way and said:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Before you go complaining about me, think. Have I ever been unkind to you? When you asked me to come to you for the evening to please you, did I ever refuse?"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Never," the old man admitted. "You always came to me as I asked."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"Have I ever been stingy, unwilling, or cold to you? Have I refused to give you what you wanted from me?"&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"No," he repeated, more modestly now. "You always gave me everything I asked for."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;"So tell me, what was I supposed to do with what was left? Feed it to the pigs? Lock it in a chest and throw away the key? After all, isn't it better to please another man who loves me? It doesn't take away from what's rightfully yours."&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;The lord felt ashamed at the words and had to admit that his wife was right and that Plümmel, the town clerk, still knows nothing of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;subtitle&gt;A. von Wallenstein and Raimund R. Hardt on men and women&lt;/subtitle&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;As many, and men in particular, will gladly testify, of the two generations, it is the female that is imperfect, prone to all manner of sins and faults. It is an old known truth that the testimony of many is a credible testimony, the truth of which cannot be doubted. But who hath appointed the woman her lot? God? Or man? Who has decreed that woman is incapable of thinking, acting and deciding without the guidance of man?
&lt;paragraph&gt;By whom was it determined that women were too foolish and vice-ridden to participate in matters wholly male - politics, science, or the liberal arts? Is such a resolution supported by experience or evidence? After all, no one has ever given a woman the opportunity to demonstrate the necessary judgment and wit. We have only conveniently condemned it as inadequate, and have made this judgment an established truth which no one dares to question. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;We have witnessed many injuries to the daughters of Eve, and therefore may, or rather must, testify that the world is unjustly ordered in this respect. Men are fond of exalting themselves above women and attributing all sorts of wrongs to them, but only to cover their own faults!&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;A man who accuses a woman of vice has squandered his own youth in licentiousness. In old age, these men remember with regret the sins of their past life without ever repenting of them. It is out of this bitterness that they denounce women, in order to humiliate and vilify them in the minds of all who are willing to listen to them. These corrupt old men are like incurable leprosy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;But even more than women, men prefer to elevate themselves above other men. For example, they claim that husbands who listen to their wives' advice are fools and deserve ridicule.

The tree they chose to cut down is known for attracting lightning from far and wide to protect the good people, but it endangers the cattle in the pasture. Arbor inchoata cruentatur - Michael first struck the trunk with the axe. But no sooner had he raised the instrument to cut again, than red blood began to gush from the wound. The horrible phenomenon so frightened both men that they threw down their axes and fled home.

In ancient times, the Roman Emperor persecuted all Christians and had many cruelly martyred. Margaret was denounced by her disgraced suitor to a prefect for secretly professing faith in Christ.

She even survived drowning and burning by fire, so that eventually she had to be beheaded.

&lt;paragraph&gt;A very special herb.

&lt;paragraph&gt;I may believe in my theory, but there are limits to the courage of even a scientist like me.

&lt;paragraph&gt;I have tried to use this strange herb perhaps ten times, but always in vain. Drying, crushing, cooking, decanting, inhaling, oral, surface and rectal use,... In short, nothing works, and I have been unable to find other subjects willing to test it. Even the dumbest chelonians notice when I put something in their food! Oh how hard it is to find someone willing to sacrifice themselves for the glory of alchemy...&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Nothing to be done, I will have to give up my hemlock experiments. In short, no matter how hard I try, I have never been able to cause the flower to rotate in effect. It never seems to cure a headache. It always just causes...&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;heading&gt;Hemlock&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;I have tried to use this strange herb perhaps ten times, but always in vain. Drying, grinding, boiling, decanting, inhaling, oral, surface and rectal use,... In short, nothing works, and I have run out of subjects to test it on, due to many undesirable side effects, including death, and even the least attentive hired hand is wary, lest I put something in their food. In fact, the herb seems to induce the total opposite to the desired result, causing trembling of the hands, staggering, panting and nausea, instead of improving agility and stealth ability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Alas, I shall have to give up my experiments. In short, even the most dextrous of subjects shows no improvement in lock-picking skills - on the contrary, the herb actually causes... &lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>vezninatroskach_scribeboo_Y0C2</Cell><Cell>&lt;heading&gt;Swimmer&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Because I have had excellent success with this plant! Its potency perfectly matches the name. It was enough to extract the scent of the flowers and rub the fragrant oil on it, and I was immediately admired by all the maids and cooks. You could almost say that the effects were... Too strong...&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;A thinker like me is simply not prepared to perform such physical feats as the intoxication of the pheasant makes available to him... But I don't despair. A bit of darkness, buoyancy, and maybe a devil and a nine-force might help me in my endeavors! I could slip the local cooks some pheasant...&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;heading&gt;Mercurialis&lt;/heading&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Nevertheless, I have had promising results with this plant! Its effects are truly mercurial, causing the test subjects to run hither and thither at great speed, although they themselves naively reported that this was due to a sudden pressing urge to defecate and urinate. Running at speed is certainly a useful skill for messengers, although the tendency of the subjects to run away from people rather than towards them is admittedly a disadvantage. However, I do not despair. I still believe the addition of other ingredients, such as bittersweet nightshade, orchis mascula, or perhaps maybe calla and butterbur might reduce the side-effects and allow me to create true messengers of the gods.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;newpage/&gt;</Cell></Row>

&lt;subtitle&gt;A. von Wallenstein and Raimund R. Hardt on men and women&lt;/subtitle&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;As many, and men in particular, will gladly testify, of the two generations, it is the female that is imperfect, prone to all manner of sins and faults. It is an old known truth that the testimony of many is a credible testimony, the truth of which cannot be doubted. But who hath appointed the woman her lot? God? Or man? Who has decreed that woman is incapable of thinking, acting and deciding without the guidance of man?
&lt;paragraph&gt;By whom was it determined that women were too foolish and vice-ridden to participate in matters wholly male - politics, science, or the liberal arts? Is such a resolution supported by experience or evidence? After all, no one has ever given a woman the opportunity to demonstrate the necessary judgment and wit. We have only conveniently condemned it as inadequate, and have made this judgment an established truth which no one dares to question. &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;We have witnessed many injuries to the daughters of Eve, and therefore may, or rather must, testify that the world is unjustly ordered in this respect. Men are fond of exalting themselves above women and attributing all sorts of wrongs to them, but only to cover their own faults!&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;A man who accuses a woman of vice has squandered his own youth in licentiousness. In old age, these men recall with regret the sins of their past life without ever repenting of them. It is out of this bitterness that they denounce women, in order to humiliate and vilify them in the minds of all who are willing to listen to them. These corrupt old men are like incurable leprosy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;But even more than women, men prefer to elevate themselves above other men. For example, they claim that husbands who listen to their wives' advice are fools and deserve ridicule. But we say that a man who has a wife who is sensible and wise, and refuses to listen to her, is twice as foolish!</Cell><Cell>&lt;newpage/&gt;&lt;heading&gt;Repent, Adam's Gender&lt;/heading&gt;
