<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_carodejnictvi</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In the Czech lands, any practices (especially by women) connected with magic that were intended to harm rather than help were regarded as witchcraft. In the early Middle Ages, witchcraft was differentiated into &lt;italic&gt;white&lt;/italic&gt; magic – beneficial and associated with healing, and &lt;italic&gt;black&lt;/italic&gt; magic – curses, hexes and abuse of magic for iniquitous purposes. Magic encompassed divination, necromancy, alchemy, herbalism, entrenched pagan customs and rituals, which had originally constituted an integral part of medieval society.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;

Thus, it was not only important to build up one’s honour, but also to defend it. Honour could be lost not only through a violation of the social order (an illegitimate child, loss of virginity before marriage), but also a violation of unwritten conventions (shaking hands with an executioner, the treatment of a dead person or animal) or simply by not resisting when someone questioned your honour.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In the medieval perception of the world, there were also &lt;italic&gt;honourless people&lt;/italic&gt;, meaning those who had no honour.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_city_garrison</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Maintaining law and order in the medieval town was the job of the Bailiff. From the 14th century onward, the function was taken over by the &lt;italic&gt;catchpole&lt;/italic&gt;, then &lt;italic&gt;night watchmen&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;guards&lt;/italic&gt; on towers. The catchpole, along with the Bailiff, the executioner or their henchmen also carried out the punishment of transgressors. They were not, however, allowed to enter freehold dwellings (the palaces and houses of the nobility, the ruling class), nor Church buildings or the University, a fact students took advantage of. &lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
&lt;accent&gt;Order&lt;/accent&gt; within the city also had to be upheld by the townsfolk themselves. They were obligated to report not only any crime, but, just like the night watchmen, to call out the hours and warn of fire, flood or tempest. For safety it was forbidden to wander at night with any open flame (torch or candle) into any castles, chambers, stables, barns or byres. Only lanterns could be used. To keep the peace at night, all taverns had to shut at sunset. 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
In the medieval city, &lt;accent&gt;military service&lt;/accent&gt; was entrusted to either hired professionals or the townspeople themselves. Every healthy adult male had to serve at least a few days a year in the civic guard, the city walls being divided and allocated in sections to each district or trade, and it was here that they mustered whenever an alarm was raised.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In practice, the wealthy burghers bought their way out of serving in the militia, leaving other men to take their turn, and these poorer men welcomed the extra income – thus gradually forming a professional municipal gendarmerie.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Each man had to procure the armour and weapons needed for serving in the guards and the militia, unless his guild did so. Only the rich cities could afford to have a public issue armoury. 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;The right to bear arms&lt;/accent&gt; outside of ‘duty' was reserved for townsmen of sufficient means. Within the city walls a simple melee weapon, dagger or knife had to suffice. Only the really wealthy townsmen wore  swords, taking after the nobility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In medieval towns, law and order were maintained by the bailiff.

The catchpole, along with the bailiff, executioner or their henchmen, also carried out punishments on offenders. However, they were not allowed to enter free houses (palaces and houses of nobles, rulers), church buildings, or universities, which students often exploited.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Order&lt;/accent&gt; in the town had to be maintained by the townspeople themselves.

To maintain night peace, all taverns had to close after sunset.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In a medieval town, &lt;accent&gt;military service&lt;/accent&gt; was performed either by hired professionals or by the town's citizens themselves. Every healthy adult man was expected to serve in the town's garrison for at least a few days a year. Different quarters or guilds had their own sections of the town walls to guard, and in the event of an alarm, the town's defenders would gather at these sections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In practice, wealthy townspeople would pay others to perform guard duties for them, hiring poorer men who saw this as a welcome source of income—thus gradually forming a professional town guard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Each guard and town militia member provided their own armour and weapons, unless their guild provided it. Only wealthy towns could afford their own state armoury.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;The right to bear arms&lt;/accent&gt; outside of "service" was only granted to townspeople with a certain level of property. Inside the town walls, a simple stabbing weapon, dagger, or knife had to suffice. Only truly wealthy townspeople carried swords, following the example of the nobility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_cizinci</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Since ancient times, a ‘foreigner' meant not only anyone who came from outside one's town or village (and was thus a potential enemy), but also any person without legal status. Foreigners were without legal rights until they paid a surety. This matter was handled by courts of law and there were various regulations setting fees for running a business or renting a house (foreigners were not allowed to acquire or inherit ownership of them).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
The Bohemia lands were long open to foreigners, relatively speaking, with lively trade and cultural exchanges. First were the Celts, then Germanic tribes and later the Slavs, but a large portion of the populace consisted of German-speaking people. The Germans were mainly courtiers, or worked entrepreneurs and merchants. Relations with the Germans were neutral at first, cooling off later and ending up with animosity ‘against all things German', though that was still far removed from the strident nationalism of the 19th century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
Worse relations existed between the Czechs and Germans, on one side, and the Jews on the other. They lived outside of society, which often (having got permission from the King for a handsome price) carried out pogroms against them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
Plague and disease in the mid-14th century affected migration, and fewer foreigners came to Bohemia. During the Hussite Wars, most of towns had a majority Czech citizenry. Only the main centres in Moravia remained largely German: Brno (Brünn), Jihlava (Iglau) and Olomouc (Olmütz).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The Czech language gradually permeated from rural society to the higher social strata. A fundamental change in how language and ethnicity was viewed came with the Hussite Wars, in which most Czech-speakers identified with the Hussites, while (most) Germans supported Sigismund and the Pope. This was exacerbated by the foreign (often German) crusades summoned by Sigismund against the “upstart Hussites”.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In ancient times, a foreigner was not only someone who did not originate from the community (and therefore a potential enemy), but also a person without legal status. Foreigners were considered without rights until they paid a surety. Courts and various regulations addressed issues such as fees for trading or renting a house (which they were not allowed to acquire or inherit).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The Czech lands remained relatively open to foreigners for a long time, fostering active cultural and commercial exchanges. Initially inhabited by Celts, they were later replaced by Germanic tribes and eventually by Slavs, although with a significant proportion of German speakers. Germans mostly lived on royal estates or worked as entrepreneurs and merchants. The relationship with Germans was initially neutral, but later cooled and became more strained, leading to local hostility "against all things German," although classic nationalism of the 19th century had not yet emerged.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Both Czechs and Germans had worse relations with Jews, who lived outside society and were often subjected to pogroms (with the king's permission and hefty payments).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Diseases and the Black Death in the mid-14th century influenced migration, resulting in fewer foreigners moving to the Czech lands. During the Hussite Wars, Czechs became the majority in most cities. German remained the main language in Moravia's major centres: Brno, Jihlava, and Olomouc.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Czech gradually evolved from a rural language into a language of the upper classes. A pivotal shift in the perception of linguistic and ethnic differences occurred during the Hussite Wars, where most Czech speakers identified with the Hussites, while Germans (for the most part) sided with Sigismund and the Pope. Foreign (often German) crusades against the "rebellious Hussites," convened by Sigismund, also contributed to these divisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_crime</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;The most severe crimes in the Middle Ages were considered a murder, incest, counterfeiting money, sorcery, burglary and large-scale theft.

Worse than the pillorying itself was the loss of honour for the condemned, which then dragged with them and their family for the rest of their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Capital crimes&lt;/accent&gt; were punished by hanging (the most common form of execution of men, mainly for recurring crimes) or by beheading (reserved for the nobility). For &lt;accent&gt;aggravated murder&lt;/accent&gt; the punishment was the breaking wheel, which was left on the gallows hill complete with the corpse, as a warning. Other options for execution were burning at the stake (for heretics and forgers), drawing by horses, quartering and impaling. Women were typically drowned, or in retribution for killing a newborn, buried alive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;It was possible to &lt;accent&gt;redeem oneself&lt;/accent&gt; from some wrongdoings. The penalty levied went to the town coffers, or part went to the aggrieved party in compensation. Murder could also be redeemed if the offender paid off the survivors and put up a conciliation cross.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;A special kind of punishment was &lt;accent&gt;branding&lt;/accent&gt;, which was considered one of the most severe punishments. Those branded had trouble getting an "honorable" job, as they had a reminder right on their body that they had been involved in a crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The nobility were virtually unpunishable, even if they had committed a serious crime.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_dogs_cats</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Throughout the Middle Ages, animals were seen only in purely utilitarian terms: the same was true of dogs and cats.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Although the Church claimed that animals had a soul, their souls were mortal (unlike those of humans) and could not find salvation. They were therefore inferior beings and subordinate to man. (The Ottoman law of 1502, which regulates the use of draft animals, was a breakthrough in this area and can be considered to be possibly the first law against animal cruelty. In Europe, a similar law did not appear until 1822.)&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;At the time of our game, &lt;accent&gt;dogs&lt;/accent&gt; were used for hunting or guarding and could be trained. It therefore comes as no surprise that they enjoyed certain privileges compared to the other animals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;People were breeding and cross breeding dogs already in the Middle Ages, but not to such an extent as a few centuries later, when various domestic, miniature, or specialised breeds were beginning to emerge. Most of the medieval breeds were focused purely on hunting and guarding, and looked similar to Henry's Mutt.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Compared to that, &lt;accent&gt;cats&lt;/accent&gt; do whatever they want, and perhaps that is why they were perceived negatively as an embodiment of the devil and did not enjoy much popularity (hence their surviving miniatures, which often look more like hellish creatures).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The opposite was true for Muslims. Christian travellers in Arab countries were very surprised to find that cats were as popular there as dogs were in Europe.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Throughout the Middle Ages, animals were viewed purely for their utility: this was no different for dogs and cats.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Although animals, according to the Church, had souls, these souls were mortal and could not attain salvation, unlike human souls. Thus, animals were considered inferior beings, subordinate to humans.

A similar law in Europe appeared only in 1822.)&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The &lt;accent&gt;dog&lt;/accent&gt; in this period served humans for hunting or guarding and could be trained.

Most medieval breeds were focused solely on hunting and guarding and looked similar to Henry's Mutt.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The &lt;accent&gt;cat&lt;/accent&gt;, on the other hand, did what it wanted, and perhaps for this reason, it was viewed negatively as an embodiment of the devil and was not very popular (as evidenced by surviving illuminations, where it often appears more like a demonic creature).&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Conversely, the situation was entirely different among Muslims.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_domaci_zvirata</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In the Middle Ages a significant part of any property ownership consisted of livestock: horses, goats, cattle and poultry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Horses&lt;/accent&gt; were highly prized, and until the 12th century were only available for the nobility for military purposes and for light hauling. The change came in the 12th and 13th centuries, when horses came to be used for transport and tillage.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
In Bohemia, horses began to be shod from the 11th and 12th century - up to the 13th only as a rule on the front hooves, and later, when horses were used for heavier work, on all four.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
Almost every serf in the Middle Ages would prefer to own a &lt;accent&gt;cow&lt;/accent&gt; than a piece of arable land, so even some landless folk had access to food by way of milk. Curiously enough, in the Middle Ages milk and dairy goods were not traded much – for one thing, many people had a cow of their own, but also because no effective means of milk and dairy product preservation was yet known.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
&lt;accent&gt;Sheep&lt;/accent&gt; were kept by both serfs and the upper classes, largely for their wool. The poorest often kept a goat for milk and cheese.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Pigs&lt;/accent&gt; were left to forage in the woods all year round, feeding on beechnuts and acorns. Medieval pigs were much like wild boar and had little in common with today's pink animals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
The most commonly kept poultry were &lt;accent&gt;chickens&lt;/accent&gt;, and only rarely geese or ducks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;

The gravedigger was also not allowed to be present at the funerals of those deemed dishonourable in the eyes of the church, such as suicides or delinquents, for whom denial of burial represented the church's ultimate punishment for breaking its laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Gravediggers belonged among the undesirables on the margins of society, the only one who came into contact with them was the parish priest.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_gun</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Firearms first appeared in Europe in the 14th century and began to see widespread use by the early 15th century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;In the Kingdom of Bohemia, they became pivotal during the Hussite Wars. Interestingly, the Hussites influenced the naming of early firearms, which spread worldwide. For example, the English word &lt;italic&gt;pistol&lt;/italic&gt; for the lightest handheld firearm originates from the Czech &lt;italic&gt;píšťala&lt;/italic&gt;, originally meaning a pipe or flute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;This weapon featured a relatively short forged barrel with a socket mounted on a wooden shaft, allowing the shooter to hold it under their arm. The ammunition included solid balls, grapeshot or specially-shaped projectiles that whistled in flight to frighten horses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Gunpowder was poured into the barrel, sealed with wadding and the projectile was inserted, all then tamped down with a ramrod. It was ignited through a touchhole using a smouldering fuse or a heated piece of iron. Early firearms were highly inaccurate and had a short range, barely a few dozen metres, but even at that distance, they could pierce solid armour.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Another popular handheld firearm in Central Europe was the hook gun. It featured a steel or bronze barrel with an average calibre of 20 to 30 mm, mounted on a wooden stock. Like the píšťala, it had a hook under the muzzle, which allowed the weapon to be braced against a wall, parapet or the edge of a battle wagon during firing, significantly reducing its heavy recoil.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Waste was taken outside the house, into the fields, or disposed of in cesspits. Outside the house would be toilets built over sewage pits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;A typical village house was single-storey, with the front door leading in from the courtyard into a central space, off which was a living room and a chamber.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_hunter</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Gamekeeping and hunting in the Middle Ages were not only for amusement, but chiefly a source of great profit for the King and the nobility who owned the woods. The feudal &lt;accent&gt;huntsmen&lt;/accent&gt; also undertook woodsmanshi, in addition to their obligation to look after the game, they took charge of the forest and its protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In the forests it was prohibited to hunt deer, fallow-deer, boar or any other game, violation of which was a criminal act subject to heavy fines, or even, in the case of repeated infringements, physical punishment. The same was true for unauthorized logging and collecting of timber.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Many &lt;accent&gt;poachers&lt;/accent&gt; came from the ranks of the poor and had not very much to lose, which quite often resulted in physical conflicts with the huntsman when they were caught red-handed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Hunting in the Middle Ages was not only a pastime but also brought significant economic profit to the king and the nobility who owned the forests.

Violating this prohibition was punishable by a high fine, or in the case of repeated offenses, even physical punishment. The same applied to unauthorized wood gathering and logging.&lt;/paragraph&gt; &lt;paragraph&gt;Many &lt;accent&gt;poachers&lt;/accent&gt; came from poorer social classes and had little to lose, so physical confrontations with the gamekeepers who caught them in the act were not uncommon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_hygiena</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Sufficient supplies of drinking water constituted a crucial matter for the medieval town. The townspeople often solved the issue by excavating &lt;accent&gt;wells&lt;/accent&gt; in the grounds of their houses or even in the cellar. Apart from these, there were also public wells.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The same usually applied in castles, where a well was often dug out to collect water from a nearby source, such as a stream. Well-building was very costly and not possible everywhere. Castle wells could reach enormous depths, in extreme cases even more than 100m deep.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;It proved more effectual to build a cistern - a tank that resembled a well, but did not have its own water source. They usually collected rain water, which was filtered, and would be emptied out once a year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
As well as the obtaining fresh water, &lt;accent&gt;drainage&lt;/accent&gt; was necessary. The building of simple sewers or drains is attested to by instructions from aldermen regulating that these sewers be dug and maintained, follow the shortest route and covered from above. Especially in towns, open ditches along paved roads served as drains.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Such a system of sewage disposal was a nuisance to the populace, a source of unpleasant smells and spread infectious diseases and epidemics. Hence the originally open ditches were progressively covered over, eventually replaced by brick &lt;accent&gt;sewers&lt;/accent&gt;, which diverted rainwater from the streets and roofs to the nearest watercourse or pond. The regularly recurring epidemics spreading around Europe later demanded a more radical solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;An adequate supply of drinking water was a crucial issue for medieval towns. Townspeople often addressed this problem by building a &lt;accent&gt;well&lt;/accent&gt; on their property or digging one directly in their cellar. Public wells were also established alongside private ones.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Similarly, on castles, a well was often dug to channel water from water sources such as a nearby stream. Castle wells could reach enormous depths, in extreme cases over 100 meters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Building a well was very expensive and not always possible. A more economical solution proved to be the installation of a cistern, a reservoir that resembled a well but did not have its own water source. Most often, rainwater was directed into such a cistern, where it was filtered and would be emptied out once a year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In addition to acquiring water, its &lt;accent&gt;drainage&lt;/accent&gt; was also addressed. The emergence of simple drains or conduits is evidenced by council regulations that required these drains to be deepened and maintained, led by the shortest route, and covered from above. In towns, especially, open ditches alongside paved roads were used for drainage.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Such a waste disposal system was bothersome to the population and was a source of odor, spreading infectious diseases and epidemics. Therefore, the originally open ditches were gradually covered, and later, brick &lt;accent&gt;sewers&lt;/accent&gt; were constructed to channel rainwater from the streets and roofs of houses to the nearest watercourse or pond. However, the regularly recurring epidemics that spread across Europe demanded more radical solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_hygiene</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;From the 13th century on, waste was dumped behind the house or buried in pits. &lt;accent&gt;Toilets&lt;/accent&gt; consisted of cesspits topped with a wooden superstructure with a seat or just a board.

It was not uncommon for a latrine to be shared between several dwellings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In the inhospitable and badly-heated castles, there were sometimes &lt;accent&gt;bathrooms&lt;/accent&gt; with bathtubs or even plunge pools. Swimming was attractive not just as a means of cleansing the body, but also for pleasure. In private houses a bathroom was a sign of luxury and high status.

The most common acts of hygiene included hand washing. Even the poorest homes affording a basin with a water pitcher or a suspended water cistern with a faucet. The cleanest people were villagers, who would often wash in the stables or the river.

Even before the outbreak of plague, agriculture was experiencing a crisis, as its production was no longer sufficient to feed the growing continental population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The west was ravaged by the Hundred Years' War between England and France, while in Eastern Europe the Teutonic Order and the Polish state were engaged in a long term conflict in the Baltic region. The Russian state was subjugated by the Mongol rulers of the Golden Horde and further south, the Ottoman Empire, which would later become a traditional enemy of Europe in the early modern period, was growing ever stronger. In addition to these major conflicts, there were numerous peasant uprisings, especially in the west.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Universal unity&lt;/accent&gt;, an important pillar of the medieval world order, was shaken by papal schisms, the long-term inability to resolve this situation, conflicts within the Church itself, and the weakening of the emperor's position.

Already by the mid-14th century a chancery of provincial Millers – experts in the field of water law, was set up, with powers to survey watercourses, stipulate the scale of mill earthworks, to assess the technical condition of the mills and so on. They also drew up a code of conduct for millers to go by, so as to ensure their use of water for grinding caused no harm to others.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Since the mills stood apart from the other village houses, millers were often the subject of gossip and were accused of earn money on the side in nefarious ways – from selling customers short on flour, to outright witchcraft, or thievery and trafficking in stolen goods.

Over the centuries, the mechanism was perfected, and by the Middle Ages, a mill was present in almost every village. There were also windmills and mills powered by oxen, known as "jentour". Milling was one of the so-called free trades, and millers also ensured trade in the village.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;With the increasing number of water mills and other water-powered devices, it became necessary to establish relationships between individual millers. As early as the mid-14th century, a board of sworn millers – experts in water law – was established. They were primarily tasked with measuring watercourses, determining the levels of mill weirs, assessing the technical condition of mills, and so on. They also established a set of principles that millers had to follow to ensure that the use of water for milling did not harm others.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Since mills were often located away from other rural buildings, millers frequently became the subject of gossip and were attributed many negative side activities – from cheating customers on flour to witchcraft, theft, and trafficking in stolen goods.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_pastime</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;The medieval nobleman spent his leisure time hunting, playing games, singing or playing a musical instrument. Special entertainments consisted of tournaments, dances and plays. Books were rarely read, because they were rare and expensive and most of the nobility was illiterate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
In the countryside, there were also many opportunities for amusement. Work was strictly forbidden on Church holidays and on Sundays, and there were many more feast days than there are today. In the case of certain professions, the working week could also be interrupted due to weather or unpredictable events. Usually people worked about 190 days a year, which comes out to an average of 4-5 days a week, but the work was not evenly distributed during the year. For example, there was much more work around harvest season than in winter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
The most popular medieval &lt;accent&gt;board games&lt;/accent&gt; were chess, draughts (checkers), backgammon, Mill (also called Nine Men's Morris), Hnefatafl, Fox and Geese and dice. &lt;accent&gt;Ball games&lt;/accent&gt; were also played. Chess was costly and time consuming to play and was therefore restricted mainly to noble circles. Burghers favoured draughts and common folk were fond of the simpler games of dice and Mill. Cards and card games already existed in Europe at the end of the 14th century, but only spread more widely later with the spread of printing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The bourgeois, emulating the nobility in their leisure time, took to &lt;accent&gt;bird shooting&lt;/accent&gt;, for example. During the 15th century archery fellowships began to form in the townships.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
&lt;accent&gt;Gambling&lt;/accent&gt; was also widespread throughout the Middle Ages, regardless of gender or status, which is evidenced, for example, by the &lt;italic&gt;Maiestas Carolina Act&lt;/italic&gt; of December 1357, in which Emperor Charles IV himself forbade gambling at Christmas time and commissioned Prague Archbishop Arnošt of Pardubice to penalise offenders of any social class with fines as well as spiritual penance (in extreme cases, even excommunication).&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;A medieval nobleman spent his leisure time hunting, playing games, singing, or playing musical instruments.

Of course, &lt;accent&gt;ball games&lt;/accent&gt; were also common. Chess was time-consuming and costly, so it was more popular among the nobility. Backgammon was favoured by townspeople, while the common folk enjoyed simpler games like dice or nine men's morris. Playing cards and card games appeared in Europe by the late 14th century, but due to limited paper production, they became widespread much later.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Townsmen sought to emulate the nobility in their leisure activities, engaging, for example, in &lt;accent&gt;bird shooting&lt;/accent&gt;. During the 15th century, archery fellowships even began to form in cities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Gambling games&lt;/accent&gt; were widespread across medieval society regardless of gender or social status. This is evidenced, for example, by the &lt;italic&gt;Maiestas Carolina&lt;/italic&gt; legal code from December 1350, where Charles IV himself forbade playing games during Christmas time, and empowered the Archbishop of Prague, Arnošt of Pardubice, to prosecute offenders of any status with fines or spiritual penalties (in extreme cases, excommunication).&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_pastime_lov</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Hunting was always a source of meat and furs, mainly for the lesser nobility. For the aristocracy, courtly hunting was more for enjoyment, being much cheaper entertainment than tournaments, while providing similar thrills. It became a favourite pastime and chasing game with dogs became almost a ritual.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Hunting weapons&lt;/accent&gt; were similar to those used in battle: bows, crossbows, spears, daggers. &lt;accent&gt;Dogs&lt;/accent&gt; were used to track and chase down game until the exhausted animal stood its ground in last defence. Then came the moment for the hunters (up till then only following the sound of the baying hounds), to down the animal with an arrow or spear. Finishing off on the ground was done with a sword or dagger. &lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
&lt;accent&gt;Falconry - hunting with a falcon&lt;/accent&gt; (originating in the Orient) and other specifically trained raptors (goshawks and sparrowhawks) was more of a fashion, a pursuit for both men and women.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The poorer classes were not allowed to hunt in the forests, subject to strict penalties (with the exception of hare-hunting).&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Hunting always provided sustenance and furs, mainly for the lower nobility.

Only then did the hunters (following on horseback to the sound of the dogs’ barking) arrive to kill it with arrows or spears. The final kill on the ground was done with a sword or hunting knife.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;Falconry&lt;/accent&gt; (originally a pastime from the Orient), and hunting with other specially trained birds of prey (hawks and goshawks) was more of a fashionable activity and could be pursued by women as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;For the lower classes, hunting in the lord’s forests was strictly prohibited under severe penalties (with the exception of hunting hares).&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_pilgrimage</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Religious pilgrimages were an important part of the Christian world. There were many reasons to go on pilgrimage. To seek forgiveness of sins, to save the soul of the pilgrim or his or her loved ones from a stay in purgatory, to ask for healing or other heavenly help, to express thanksgiving, or to express deep piety and seek to deepen it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The purpose of pilgrimages was to visit places associated with Christ's residence and ministry or places of rest of the saints.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;The most important places&lt;/accent&gt; were the city of Jerusalem and the site of the Holy Sepulchre. In Europe, Rome, the seat of the popes associated with the ministry of St. Peter, and Santiago de Compostella, with the relics of St. James, were among the most visited places. In the Czech lands, the most important place of pilgrimage was Prague, where the relics of several saints were laid to rest over time, most notably the country's patron saint, St. Wenceslas, who rested in St. Vitus Cathedral.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;To undertake a pilgrimage was to undertake an arduous and often dangerous journey, whether over land or partly by sea, and was one of the great feats of individual achievement. To provide shelter and assistance to a pilgrim was considered a matter of good manners. But of course, the development of pilgrimage was also linked to economic and commercial factors, especially around pilgrimage sites and travel inns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;accent&gt;The pilgrim&lt;/accent&gt; could often be identified by his &lt;accent&gt;specific clothing&lt;/accent&gt;, which is also seen in many depictions. This was most often a sack, cloak, pilgrim's staff, pilgrim badges, and a frequent motif, or even symbol, was the St. James scallop. It was a popular item and it was believed that such a shell brought back from a pilgrimage was blessed and therefore had supernatural powers. This shell was therefore sometimes placed, for example, at the bottom of a well to ensure the purity of the water.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Religious pilgrimages were an important part of the Christian world.

The Piast dynasty, for many years the unifying and ruling dynasty, ceases to exist by the sword.

Thus the Polish-Lithuanian coalition was formed, which took the wind out of the sails of the Teutonic Knights.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;However, the Crusaders would not surrender so easily, and so the war continued for many more years.

In view of the unsavoury smells they gave off, tanners settled on the outskirts of towns and belonged to the same reviled group as executioners, knackers and prostitutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;To turn hide into a material for shoes or clothing, after skinning the animal it must first be thoroughly soaked in water. Once softened, it is fleshed, the residual gore and membranes are scraped off, with a long dull paring knife. In order to rid the hide of fur, it had to be soaked in limewater or rubbed with slaked lime, then scudded. It was then tanned using alum (by a Currier), with fishoil (by the Chamoisier) or with tannins (dealt with by Tanner) from oak, beech or other tree bark.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;During this whole lengthy process the hide softened, was stopped from decomposing and optionally turned a different colour. At the end of the process, the hides were submerged for a few weeks in vats or pits full of urine. The leather thus produced was then dried, possibly coated, painted or polished.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Once softened, they were scraped of any remaining flesh and membranes using a long blunt knife. To remove fur, hides were soaked in lime water for two weeks or smeared with slaked lime. They were then tanned using either alum (handled by a tawer), fats (handled by a chamoiser), or tannins (handled by the tanner) from oak, beech, or other barks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;This lengthy process made the hides supple, prevented decomposition, and sometimes changed their color.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_troji_lid</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;It served as a figurative description of the ideal medieval society. The theory was that God divided society into three groups: warriors, clerics and peasants. The warriors were supposed to defend society and included nobility, soldiers and executors of state power. The clergy cared for salvation and education, and those serving the church or educated scholars could also be included here. The last category included the greatest mass of society; the task of the peasants was to work and feed the whole society.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
A well-known Latin proverb says: Tu ora, tu protege, tu labora. (You pray, you protect, you work)
Though the division into classes is determinant and limits the freedom of social mobility, at the same time it guarantees social harmony. Everyone knows where his place is, what is expected of him and what plans God has for him. 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;
It wasn’t until the 15th century that some church reformers began to break down the teachings. For example, Petr Chelčický (a follower of John Hus) came up with a bold thesis that all people are equal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Serving as a figurative description of the ideal medieval society, the theory was that God divided society into three groups: warriors, clerics and peasants. The warriors were supposed to defend society and included nobility, soldiers and executors of state power. The clergy cared for salvation and education, and those serving the church and educated scholars could also be included here. The last category comprised the greatest mass of society; the task of the peasants was to work and feed the whole society.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;

At issue was the legacy and power of a dynasty that had aspired to the Polish and Hungarian Crowns. After the death of Charles IV, both brothers supported the policies of Hungarian King Sigismund, but when he imprisoned King Wenceslas IV in 1394, Prokop sided with the Bohemian King. In return he was granted the right to occupy episcopal castles which led to his excommunication by the Pope and his subsequent capture by Sigismund. 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In 1402, Sigismund again imprisoned Wenceslas IV and tricked Prokop into captivity in Pressburg (Bratislava). That same year, Jobst switched sides from Sigismund to support Albrecht of Austria in Hungary, where an anti-royalist uprising had just begun, aiming for the release of his brother and the Czech king. Prokop gained his freedom through a peace agreement brokered between Sigismund and Jobst, after more than two years of imprisonment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The fraternal conflict between Jobst and Prokop led to anarchy in Moravia, which was exploited by a whole host of robber-barons, who set about attacking castles and villages.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;

The wine was either grown as a ground bush or staked. Today's system of wire 'rows' was not yet in use. Work on the vineyard was year-round. It was pruned twice a year, hoed frequently, and had to be rid of the pests and fungal and mildew diseases.

The earliest high-wheeled wagons had a single central axle connected to the chassis. From the 14th century onwards, two-axle four-wheeled wagons were used. The front axle was not swivellable and so the turning radius was very small. The wagons also did not have trestles, so the coachman either rode one of the horses or walked beside the wagon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;In the event of war, wagons could also be used as mobile field forts - a strategy made especially famous during the Hussite Wars, when the strategic use of "wagon forts" won the Caliphs many a battle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In the Middle Ages, carts served for travel, agricultural work, and military purposes.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_winegrower</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;In Bohemia, wine-growing began to spread from the 10th century, and this especially for liturgical reasons. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, vineyards were mainly for monasteries and the nobility, generally in similar places to where we find wine grown today: mainly in South Moravia. Due to more favourable climatic conditions vineyards were able to grow even in Bohemia, but later, after a global cooling period they died off again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Taking care of vines kept vintners occupied all year round, the vintage harvest taking place from October to November, depending on the weather. Wine tended to be grown in places unsuitable for the cultivation of other plants, such as on the rocky south-facing slopes. It could take three to four years to establish a vineyard, and it would be good for thirty to forty years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The grapes were gathered and put into vats where they were crushed by treading. White grapes were pressed immediately after crushing and the juice kept in wooden barrels, tarred and sanitized with sulphur, where the wine was left to ferment. Red wine was crushed, rid of grape seeds and left to ferment in open vats, stirred regularly. This produced what is termed the ‘mash', and after a few days this was pressed and the juice poured into barrels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;King Charles IV was a great wine-lover, who imported grapevines from France together with wine-growing know-how and granted numerous privileges to vintners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

This produced a substance known as "must," which was pressed after a few days, and the entire mixture was then transferred to barrels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;A great lover of wine was King Charles IV, who imported cultivation methods and certain grape varieties from France and granted numerous privileges to winemakers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

The soldier's head was protected by helmets: e.g., kapalin (so-called iron hat), pawls, and helmets.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;The armour was made by plate makers or helmet makers, most often from a single piece of cloudy sheet metal (skulls, pawls) or knitted from several smaller pieces (kapalin, buckets). The best armour of the early 15th century is considered to be that made in German and Italian countries. The armour of the so-called "combined type" was used by heavy cavalry - the basis was ring armour supplemented by a cloth covering of the limbs and a simpler form of cuirass, cloth coat or just a quilting. Some plate coats and breastplates have a hook on which the knight's lance was supported in battle. If the armour did not have a hook, the spear was inserted into a cut-out in the shield, which covered the left arm controlling the reins and the lower part of the helmet. A very widespread helmet was the bascinet (tread) with a distinctively shaped visor nicknamed the dog's muzzle. Furthermore, iron hats, often with one or two visors, appear abundantly in pictorial sources. The shoulders were protected either by ring sleeves or small epaulettes.

When that was insufficient, torches (flambeaux) were used to illuminate pathways or dwellings in the Middle Ages, along with lanterns, oil lamps and candles.

In wealthier households, chandeliers were hung from the ceiling with chains. In villages, simple lamps burned tallow instead of vegetable oils, and split wood torches were used. Tallow candles were smelly, smoky, and melted quickly. They needed to be wiped, and the tallow collected for reuse, which is why they were placed in holders with a bowl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In Central Europe, beeswax was considered an extraordinarily expensive commodity in the Middle Ages and was even used as a form of payment for guild fees ("payment in wax").&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>

For this reason, they initially enjoyed respectability, and many rulers and monarchs gave them safe conducts, securing free passage and protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;However, at the same time as migration to continental Europe, disagreements and clashes between cultures began to arise. The Romani, as bearers of foreign cultural practices and dress, often encountered misunderstandings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Despite the difficulties of coexistence, the Romani tried to survive as best they could. They were renowned horse breeders, blacksmiths and musicians, and their ability to control the supernatural is often mentioned. The latter, however, is rather an attempt to attribute to unknown things an unearthly origin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Based on linguistic analysis of the Romani language, we know that their origin comes from India. However, why migration to the west occurred between the 5th and 10th centuries AD can only be speculated upon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;In the early 15th century, several groups of nomadic Roma, numbering from dozens to hundreds of people, may already have been moving across Czech lands. Records indicate that they presented themselves as Christian refugees expelled from the Holy Land after its conquest by the Arabs. This initial portrayal earned them respect, and many rulers and sovereigns provided them with passes ensuring free passage and protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;However, along with their migration into continental Europe, cultural misunderstandings and conflicts began to arise. The Roma, with their exotic cultural practices and attire, often faced incomprehension.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Despite the difficult coexistence, the Roma tried to survive as best they could. They were renowned horsemen, blacksmiths, and musicians, and their supposed ability to control the supernatural is often mentioned. The latter, however, is more likely an attribute of our tendency to attribute unknown things to an otherworldly origin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell></Row>
<Row><Cell>ui_codex_rosa_ruthard</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Rosa Ruthard is not a real historical figure. She is inspired by Rosa/Rozina from the Kuttenberg legend portrayed by the Czech dramatist Josef Kajetán Tyl. We were intrigued by the legend, but in the end we kept only the name from the story about the daughter of a rich nobleman from the Ruthard family. The original story goes like this:&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Rosa was the daughter of George Ruthard, a rich but very stingy and cruel burgher of Kuttenberg. She was not only very clever but also beautiful, so she had no shortage of suitors. However, this was something her father feared, as the last thing he wanted was to cut short his treasure for his daughter's dowry. He therefore insured his fortune in a very cruel way - he had his daughter walled up in the same cellar where he kept his possessions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;&lt;paragraph&gt;Rosa's ghost later haunted the house and its surroundings, even in the street near the house people could hear her crying at night. Often the ghost would appear to the inhabitants of the house and foretell terrible misfortune. Later, this actually happened - in 1648, the house collapsed, burying all those inside.&lt;/paragraph&gt;</Cell><Cell>&lt;paragraph&gt;Rosa Ruthard is not a documented historical figure.
