# **An In-Depth Analysis of the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Armor System: Layering, Stats, and Strategic Implications**

## **1\. Introduction: Deconstructing Henry's Wardrobe \- The KCD2 Armor System**

Kingdom Come: Deliverance carved a unique niche in the RPG landscape through its commitment to historical realism, particularly evident in its intricate armor system. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (KCD2) continues this tradition, presenting players with a complex, multi-layered approach to personal protection and appearance that significantly influences gameplay. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the KCD2 armor system, dissecting its components, mechanics, and strategic considerations. It aims to illuminate the dependencies between armor slots, the function and calculation of various armor statistics, the distinct properties of different materials, and how these elements coalesce to impact combat effectiveness, stealth capabilities, social interactions, and overall immersion within the game's 15th-century Bohemian setting.

Understanding this system is paramount for players seeking to navigate the challenges of KCD2 effectively. The armor mechanics extend far beyond simple damage reduction; they dictate feasibility for stealth, influence NPC reactions through charisma and appearance, and impose realistic constraints through weight and maintenance requirements. Success hinges not merely on acquiring the "best" gear, but on thoughtfully selecting and managing appropriate attire for diverse situations. The system rewards careful planning and adaptation, pushing players towards strategic choices rather than straightforward statistical maximization. This analysis will proceed by examining the foundational structure of armor slots and layering, decoding the individual stats, explaining how overall character attributes are derived, comparing material properties, and finally, exploring strategic applications through the game's outfit management system.

## **2\. Foundation: Armor Slots and Layering Dependencies**

The foundation of the KCD2 armor system lies in its granular approach to equipment slots, reflecting the historical practice of layering garments and armor for protection and comfort. The player character, Henry, has access to 16 distinct armor slots, allowing for a high degree of customization.1

**The 16 Armor Slots:** 1

1. **Helmet:** Primary head protection (e.g., Bascinet, Kettle Hat).  
2. **Cap:** Often worn under helmets or as standalone headwear.  
3. **Hood:** Outer head/shoulder covering, affects appearance and potentially stealth.  
4. **Coif:** Padded or mail head/neck protection worn under helmets.  
5. **Neck Guard:** Additional neck protection (e.g., Gorget, Aventail).  
6. **Chest Plate:** Rigid torso protection (e.g., Cuirass).  
7. **Coat:** Outer torso garment, worn over other layers.  
8. **Gambeson:** Essential padded torso armor, worn under mail/plate.  
9. **Shirt:** Basic undergarment.  
10. **Sleeves:** Arm protection, sometimes separate components.  
11. **Gloves:** Hand protection (e.g., Gauntlets, Leather Gloves).  
12. **Quilted Hose:** Padded legwear, worn under mail/plate leg armor.  
13. **Shoes:** Basic footwear, required for other foot additions.  
14. **Rowel Spurs:** Accessories for riding, attached to shoes/boots.  
15. **Jewelry (Slot 1):** Rings, necklaces; affect Charisma but not defense.1  
16. **Jewelry (Slot 2):** Second slot for accessories.

**Mandatory Layering Rules:**

A defining feature of the system is its enforcement of realistic layering dependencies. Equipping heavier, more protective armor types necessitates specific underlayers, mirroring historical requirements for preventing chafing, absorbing impact, and properly supporting the outer armor.1

* **Head:** Before a rigid Helmet can be equipped, a Coif (typically padded, though mail coifs also exist) must be worn.1 This provides cushioning and foundational protection.  
* **Body:** A Gambeson or similar padded torso garment (like an Arming Doublet) is mandatory before equipping a metal Chest Plate or a Mail Hauberk.1 This padding absorbs blunt force trauma transmitted through the metal.  
* **Legs:** Quilted Hose or Padded Chausses must be worn before equipping Mail Chausses or Plate Leg Armor (like Greaves or Poleyns).1  
* **Feet:** Basic Shoes or boots must be equipped before adding items like Rowel Spurs.1 While not explicitly detailed for KCD2 yet, historically, Sabatons (plate foot armor) would also require underlying footwear.

**Optional Layers:**

Items such as Coats, Hoods, and certain Neck Guards (like cloth hoods or chaperones) generally do not have strict prerequisites and can be worn over other layers.1 These provide additional aesthetic customization, can contribute significantly to stats like Visibility, Conspicuousness, and Charisma, and may offer minor protection or weather resistance, while also adding to total Weight and potentially Noise.

The strict layering rules serve a purpose beyond mere historical flavor. They directly influence gameplay progression, particularly in the early game. Players cannot simply find or steal a piece of plate armor and immediately benefit from its high protection; they must first acquire the necessary padded underlayers.1 This structures the gearing process, potentially guiding players towards tailors or specific loot locations to find gambesons and padded hose before seeking out metal armor. It prevents illogical scenarios and reinforces the grounded nature of the world, forcing players to consider the complete ensemble rather than just the outermost, most protective piece.

**Table 1: KCD2 Armor Slot Dependencies**

| Armor Slot | Required Underlayer Slot(s) | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Helmet | Coif | Mandatory for wearing most metal helmets.1 |
| Chest Plate / Hauberk | Gambeson / Padded Torso | Mandatory for wearing plate or mail torso protection.1 |
| Mail/Plate Leg Armor | Quilted Hose / Padded Chausses | Mandatory for wearing mail or plate leg protection.1 |
| Rowel Spurs | Shoes | Requires basic footwear to be equipped.1 |
| *Other Outer Layers* | *Typically None (Worn Over Others)* | Coats, Hoods etc., usually layered on top without strict prerequisites |

This table provides a quick reference for the essential layering requirements integral to the KCD2 armor system.

## **3\. Decoding the Stats: Understanding Armor Attributes**

Each piece of armor and clothing in KCD2 possesses a range of statistics that contribute to Henry's overall capabilities and how he interacts with the world. These stats determine defensive prowess, stealth potential, social standing, and logistical considerations like encumbrance and maintenance.3 It's important to note that even items of the same type can have different stats based on their Quality rank, current Condition, and specific variant (e.g., different colors or minor design changes affecting stealth or charisma).1

**Defensive Stats:**

These stats quantify the protection offered against physical attacks.3

* **Stab Defense:** Resistance against piercing attacks, such as those from daggers, spears, arrows, or sword thrusts.  
* **Slash Defense:** Resistance against cutting attacks from swords, axes, etc. Chainmail, for example, typically offers good Slash Defense.2  
* **Blunt Defense:** Resistance against impact forces from weapons like maces, warhammers, or even unarmed strikes. Plate armor offers significant Blunt Defense, but even it can be overcome by dedicated heavy blunt weapons, while chainmail is notably weaker against blunt force.2 Unique items like the Noble's Bascinet can boast very high defensive values.4

**Stealth Stats:**

These stats govern Henry's ability to remain undetected.3 Lower values are generally better for stealth.

* **Visibility:** Determines how easily Henry is visually detected. Factors influencing this include the color and brightness of the outermost garments (dark/dull vs. bright/colorful), the material's reflectivity (polished metal is highly visible), and the ambient light level (day vs. night).7 Shiny plate armor or brightly colored noble attire significantly increases Visibility.2  
* **Conspicuousness:** Measures how much Henry stands out or attracts attention, indicating how likely NPCs are to notice and react to his presence, especially in restricted areas or when behaving suspiciously. It's influenced by the perceived value and appropriateness of clothing (expensive noble wear is more conspicuous than simple peasant garb), cleanliness, and potentially the rarity or unusual nature of the attire.7 While overlapping with Visibility, Conspicuousness relates more to recognizability and social standing.3 High Conspicuousness makes blending into crowds or trespassing difficult.  
* **Noise:** Represents the amount of sound generated by Henry's equipment during movement (walking, running, crouching). Material is the primary factor: metal armor (plate and mail) is the loudest, followed by leather, with cloth and padded armor being the quietest.7 Weight may also play a role. High Noise makes sneaking extremely difficult, as enemies can easily hear Henry's approach.

**Social & Utility Stats:**

These stats affect interactions, logistics, and item longevity.

* **Charisma:** Influences success in dialogue checks (persuasion, intimidation, etc.) and general NPC disposition. It's primarily determined by the perceived quality, style, condition, and cleanliness of Henry's *visible* outer layers of clothing.3 Expensive, clean, well-maintained noble clothing typically grants high Charisma, while dirty, damaged, or low-status gear reduces it.  
* **Weight:** The physical weight of the item. Accumulates across all equipped gear, impacting overall encumbrance. Higher total weight reduces movement speed, increases stamina consumption during actions like sprinting and combat, and potentially contributes to Noise.1 Managing weight against Henry's carrying capacity (increased by Strength) is essential.1  
* **Durability:** An item's maximum potential robustness, indicating how much use and damage it can withstand before its Condition degrades significantly.3 Higher durability means the item lasts longer between repairs.  
* **Condition:** The current state of repair of the item, usually expressed as a percentage. As Condition decreases through combat damage or wear, the item's effectiveness diminishes – defensive stats are lowered, and its appearance suffers, negatively impacting Charisma.3 Armor requires repair using kits or by visiting blacksmiths/armorers to restore Condition.1  
* **Quality:** An intrinsic property reflecting the craftsmanship or base tier of the item. Higher Quality items generally possess better base stats (defense, durability) and higher value compared to lower Quality items of the same type.3  
* **Dirt & Blood:** Dynamic indicators of the item's cleanliness. Accumulate through travel, combat, and neglecting hygiene. High levels of Dirt and Blood drastically reduce Charisma and may increase Conspicuousness, making Henry seem untrustworthy or alarming.3 Requires washing at troughs, bathhouses, or potentially via rain.8  
* **Price:** The base monetary value of the item when trading with merchants.3 Influenced by Quality, Condition, and item type/rarity.

These individual stats do not exist in isolation. The system features significant interconnectedness. An item's Condition directly impacts its defensive effectiveness and its contribution to Charisma.9 Dirt and Blood primarily affect Charisma but logically also contribute to Conspicuousness.8 Weight is a major factor influencing mobility and stamina, which are critical in combat, and it also contributes to Noise, impacting stealth.2 This web of interactions means that players must manage their equipment holistically. Neglecting armor maintenance (repair and cleaning) will not only reduce protection but also hinder social interactions and potentially make stealth more difficult, demonstrating a system where practical upkeep has tangible gameplay consequences.1

## **4\. The Sum of Its Parts: Calculating Overall Character Stats**

While each armor piece has individual stats, the game calculates Henry's overall attributes by aggregating the values from all equipped items. However, the method of aggregation varies significantly depending on the specific stat, leading to complex interactions, particularly concerning stealth and appearance.

**Visibility & Conspicuousness Calculation:**

The calculation for overall Visibility and Conspicuousness is primarily driven by the outermost layers of clothing and armor. As highlighted in the initial query, equipping a dark coat can indeed largely override the high visibility of a brightly colored tunic worn underneath.10 This "outer layer dominance" means players can strategically use coats, hoods, or tabards to manage their visual profile.

However, this override is not always absolute. The contribution of layers is described as *proportional* to how much each piece is visible.10 If an underlayer is partially exposed – for example, the sleeves of a shirt showing beneath a vest, or a mail coif visible around the neck opening of a helmet or coat – its Visibility and Conspicuousness stats will partially contribute to the overall calculation, blended with the stats of the covering layer. Therefore, achieving minimal Visibility/Conspicuousness requires ensuring that *all* visible components, even partially exposed underlayers, possess low values in these stats. A completely concealing outer garment (like a heavy cloak and hood) would offer the most effective override.

Furthermore, the context likely influences the weight of these stats. Conspicuousness might be checked more rigorously in towns or during social interactions where standing out is problematic, whereas Visibility could be the primary factor when sneaking through wilderness environments or in low light conditions.10 The time of day also drastically impacts base Visibility, with nighttime offering significant concealment bonuses.7

**Noise Calculation:**

In stark contrast to Visibility and Conspicuousness, the calculation for Noise is cumulative.10 Every piece of equipped armor contributes its individual Noise value to Henry's total Noise rating. Wearing silent cloth garments over noisy chainmail or plate armor will *not* muffle the sound of the metal underneath. The final Noise value will reflect the sum of all components. This means achieving true silence requires ensuring that *all* layers, from the shirt and hose outwards, are made of low-noise materials like cloth or perhaps light leather. Equipping even a single noisy item, like metal gauntlets or greaves, can compromise a stealthy approach.

**Charisma Calculation:**

Calculating overall Charisma is arguably the most complex. It appears to be influenced by a combination of factors related to the *visible* equipment:

1. **Item Stat:** The inherent Charisma value of each visible piece of clothing/armor contributes.3  
2. **Visibility:** Only items that are actually seen by NPCs factor in significantly. A high-charisma shirt hidden under a coat provides little to no benefit.9  
3. **Condition:** The current state of repair of visible items heavily impacts Charisma. Damaged gear looks bad and reduces social standing.9  
4. **Cleanliness:** Dirt and blood stains on visible garments drastically reduce Charisma.8 Maintaining hygiene is crucial for social success.  
5. **Base Stats/Perks:** Henry's base Charisma and certain perks (like "Fragrance" from carrying herbs) also contribute to the final value.9

The exact formula remains somewhat opaque, with player reports suggesting it might be a weighted average based on the visibility and slot of each item, rather than a simple mean, potentially explaining inconsistencies observed when swapping gear.9 Regardless of the precise math, the principle is clear: to maximize Charisma, Henry must wear high-value, clean, well-repaired clothing on his outermost, visible layers.

**Weight Calculation:**

This is the most straightforward calculation. The total weight Henry carries is simply the sum of the weights of all equipped items, plus anything carried in his inventory.1 This total weight is compared against his maximum carry capacity (determined by Strength 1), affecting movement speed and stamina consumption.2

These differing calculation methods create significant strategic depth. A player aiming for maximum stealth must minimize cumulative Noise across all layers while using outer garments to manage Visibility and Conspicuousness. Someone focusing on social encounters must prioritize the Charisma, Condition, and Cleanliness of their visible attire. A heavily armored warrior accepts high Noise and Visibility as a trade-off for protection. This necessitates careful consideration of the entire outfit and its intended purpose, reinforcing the value of specialized loadouts. The system prevents a single piece of gear from solving all problems; managing stealth requires attention to total noise, while managing appearance requires attention to the visible surface.

## **5\. Material Matters: A Comparison of Armor Types**

Beyond the specific stats of individual items, the fundamental material composition of armor dictates its general characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. KCD2 features several primary armor material categories, each offering distinct trade-offs in protection, weight, mobility, and stealth.2

**Cloth / Padded (Gambesons, Doublets, Shirts, Hose):**

* **Profile:** These items form the base layers of most outfits. They are very lightweight, allowing for high mobility and consuming minimal stamina. They are inherently quiet, offering excellent stealth potential (very low Noise, low Visibility/Conspicuousness unless brightly colored). However, they provide minimal protection against significant attacks, being primarily effective against minor impacts or glancing blows, and have poor durability.2 Padded items like Gambesons and Quilted Hose are essential underlayers required to wear heavier mail or plate armor.1  
* **Use Case:** Mandatory base layers, stealth outfits, civilian attire.

**Leather (Hardened Leather Jackets, Brigandine Vests, Gloves, Boots):**

* **Profile:** Leather offers a middle ground. It is relatively light, allowing for good mobility, and is quieter than metal armor, making it suitable for stealthy approaches, though noisier than cloth. It provides low-to-medium protection, notably better than cloth against cuts and arrows, but still vulnerable to determined strikes, particularly from blunt weapons.2 Durability is moderate. Some brigandines incorporate small metal plates riveted inside or between leather layers, offering improved protection at the cost of increased weight and noise.  
* **Use Case:** Stealth-focused combat builds, light skirmishers, archers, early-to-mid-game protection.

**Chainmail (Hauberks, Coifs, Chausses):**

* **Profile:** Constructed from interlinked metal rings, chainmail offers good protection, particularly against slashing attacks. It has medium weight and correspondingly moderate impact on mobility and stamina. Its primary drawback for stealth is its noise – the metal rings jingle and scrape during movement, resulting in low stealth potential. Chainmail is relatively ineffective against heavy blunt force trauma and concentrated piercing attacks (like arrows or spear thrusts).2 Durability is generally good. It's often worn over padding and sometimes under plate components or coats.  
* **Use Case:** Standard soldier equipment, balanced protection for frontline combat, foundational layer under plate.

**Plate (Cuirasses, Helmets, Gauntlets, Greaves, Pauldrons):**

* **Profile:** Solid plates of shaped steel provide the highest level of protection available, offering excellent resistance against slashing and piercing attacks. While very effective, plate armor is extremely heavy, significantly reducing mobility, increasing stamina drain, and making stealth virtually impossible due to high noise and often high visibility/conspicuousness.2 It is also vulnerable to specialized blunt weapons like maces and warhammers, designed to concuss the wearer through the armor. Plate armor is expensive to acquire and requires regular maintenance (repairing dents, cleaning rust) to remain effective.  
* **Use Case:** Heavy infantry, knights, maximum protection in open battle, situations where stealth and mobility are secondary.

**Mixed Armor:**

* **Profile:** Players are not restricted to using a single armor type. Combining elements – such as a plate cuirass with mail sleeves and leather boots – allows for fine-tuning the balance between protection, weight, cost, and mobility to suit specific needs or preferences.2  
* **Use Case:** Creating customized, adaptable loadouts; optimizing protection for vital areas while saving weight elsewhere.

The distinct profiles of these materials clearly illustrate a fundamental design principle within the KCD2 armor system: the trade-off triangle between Protection, Mobility, and Stealth. As one increases protection (moving from Cloth towards Plate), weight and noise inevitably increase, while mobility and stealth potential decrease.2 There is no single material type that excels in all areas. This inherent conflict forces players to make conscious decisions about their priorities based on the situation, directly leading to the strategic necessity of specialized outfits.

**Table 2: Comparative Analysis of KCD2 Armor Materials**

| Armor Type | Typical Defense Profile (Slash/Stab/Blunt) | Weight Class | Mobility Impact | Stealth Impact (Noise/Vis/Conspic) | Durability | Primary Use Case | Key Weakness |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cloth/Padded | Low / Low / Low | Very Light | High | Very High (Low / Low / Low\*) | Poor | Base Layer, Stealth, Civilian | Minimal protection |
| Leather | Medium / Low / Low | Light | High | High (Low-Med / Low / Low\*) | Moderate | Stealth Combat, Light Armor | Blunt weapons, heavy strikes |
| Chainmail | High / Medium / Low | Medium | Moderate | Low (High / Med / Med\*) | Good | Balanced Combat, Mid-Tier | Blunt weapons, focused stab/arrow |
| Plate | Very High / High / Medium-High | Very Heavy | Low | Very Low (Very High / High / High\*) | High | Heavy Combat, Max Protection | Heavy blunt weapons, weight/mobility |

*\*Visibility/Conspicuousness highly dependent on color and style, not just material.*

## **6\. Strategic Dressing: Optimizing Outfits with the Preset System**

Recognizing the situational nature of armor and the inherent trade-offs between protection, stealth, and social presentation, KCD2 provides a crucial quality-of-life feature: the ability to save and quickly swap between up to three distinct armor sets, or "outfits".1 This system is not merely convenient; it is a core mechanic enabling players to effectively adapt Henry's capabilities to the task at hand. Attempting to use a single, compromised "do-it-all" outfit is highly inefficient due to the conflicting demands of different gameplay scenarios.

**Conceptual Outfit Examples:**

Based on the principles discussed, players are encouraged to prepare specialized loadouts 2:

* **The Shadow (Stealth Outfit):** This set prioritizes minimizing Noise, Visibility, and Conspicuousness above all else. It typically consists of dark-colored cloth, padded, and potentially light leather items. Every layer should be chosen for low noise. Assembling and evaluating this outfit at night is recommended to accurately gauge its low-light Visibility.7 Protection and Charisma are heavily sacrificed. Ideal weapons are daggers or bows for silent takedowns or ranged attacks.2 Key perks might include those enhancing stealth movement or silent kills.7  
* **The Knight (Combat Outfit):** This loadout focuses purely on maximizing defensive stats (Stab, Slash, Blunt). It usually involves a full suit of plate armor worn over appropriate mail and padded underlayers. This results in very high weight, high noise, high visibility, and high conspicuousness, severely limiting mobility and rendering stealth impossible.2 Charisma might be high if the armor is ornate and well-maintained, but its primary function is battlefield survival. Suitable weapons include longswords, maces, or polearms for maximum damage output.2  
* **The Diplomat (Social Outfit):** The goal here is maximizing Charisma for success in conversations and navigating social situations. This involves wearing clean, well-repaired, high-quality clothing – often noble attire like fine tunics, coats, and jewelry.2 High Conspicuousness is acceptable, even desirable, as the aim is to impress. Defense and stealth are minimal concerns. Maintaining cleanliness through regular washing is critical for this outfit's effectiveness.8 A light sidearm like a dagger or rapier might be carried for self-defense.2  
* **(Alternative) The Traveler/Skirmisher (Balanced Outfit):** For general exploration or situations where the exact challenge is unknown, a balanced approach may be useful. This might involve mixing armor types, such as a mail hauberk for core protection, leather gloves and boots for reduced weight and noise compared to plate, and padded layers underneath.2 This offers moderate protection and mobility without completely sacrificing stealth or encumbering Henry excessively. It's a compromise suitable for road travel where ambushes are possible but heavy combat isn't guaranteed. Weapons like swords, warhammers, or crossbows offer versatility.2

**Managing Inventory & Weight:**

Carrying multiple full sets of armor, especially those including plate components, quickly exceeds Henry's weight capacity.3 Players must utilize storage options effectively. Unused outfits should be stored in the chest at Henry's lodgings or in the saddlebags of his horse.3 Swapping presets likely involves accessing one of these storage locations, reinforcing the need for planning before embarking on specific tasks.

The armor system, facilitated by the outfit presets, transforms gear selection from a passive stat check into an active tactical decision. The player must constantly evaluate the upcoming situation and choose the attire that best aligns with their intended approach. Am I planning to sneak into a camp under cover of darkness? Engage heavily armed bandits on the road? Or persuade a noble in his court? The chosen outfit becomes a tangible expression of the player's strategy, deeply integrating armor management into the core gameplay loop and rewarding foresight and preparation.

## **7\. Conclusion: Mastering Henry's Wardrobe**

The armor system in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 stands as a testament to the game's dedication to immersive, historically-grounded mechanics. It moves beyond simple damage reduction to create a multifaceted system influencing nearly every facet of gameplay. The 16 distinct armor slots and mandatory layering rules enforce a realistic approach to wearing armor, impacting early-game progression and requiring players to consider the entire ensemble.1 The diverse array of stats – encompassing defense, stealth (Visibility, Conspicuousness, Noise), social interaction (Charisma), and utility (Weight, Condition, Durability, Cleanliness) – creates a complex web of interconnected attributes.3

Mastery of the system requires understanding the nuanced ways these stats are calculated. The proportional, outer-layer-dominant calculation for Visibility and Conspicuousness contrasts sharply with the cumulative calculation for Noise, demanding different strategies for visual versus auditory concealment.10 Charisma's dependence on visible, clean, and well-repaired items adds another layer of complexity, tying social success directly to appearance and maintenance.8 The clear trade-offs presented by different armor materials – the protection-stealth-mobility triangle – ensure that no single armor type is universally optimal, forcing players into strategic choices.2

Ultimately, the KCD2 armor system, particularly when leveraged through the 3-outfit preset feature 1, encourages players to engage deeply with its mechanics. It rewards thoughtful preparation, situational awareness, and active management of Henry's attire. Choosing the right armor is not just about maximizing numbers; it's about embodying a specific approach – the silent shadow, the imposing knight, the charming diplomat. By understanding the intricacies of layering, stat interactions, material properties, and the crucial role of maintenance, players can effectively navigate the challenges of 15th-century Bohemia, turning Henry's wardrobe into a powerful tool for survival, subterfuge, and social maneuvering.
