# Kingdom Come Deliverance 2: Comprehensive Armor System and Stats Analysis

Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 features an intricate, historically accurate armor system that combines mandatory layering requirements with complex stat calculations. This deep dive explores how the layering mechanics function, how different pieces interact, and how the system affects your character's defensive and stealth capabilities.

## The Layered Armor System

Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 implements a mandatory layering system that closely mimics historical medieval armor conventions. Unlike its predecessor, KCD2 requires specific base layers before protective armor can be equipped[^1][^4].

### Base Layer Requirements

The game enforces several key dependencies for proper armor layering:

- **Head Protection**: A coif must be worn before equipping any helmet[^1]
- **Torso Protection**: A gambeson or arming doublet must be worn under a cuirass or plate armor[^1]
- **Leg Protection**: Gamboised hose or padded chausses must be worn under leg harnesses[^1][^4]
- **Footwear**: Basic shoes are required before equipping more advanced leg armor[^4]

This represents a more stringent approach than the original game, which allowed for more flexible layering[^1].

### Complete Layering Structure

The full armor layering system includes:

1. **Base Layer (Clothing)**: Includes undergarments, shirts, and basic padded armor like gambesons and arming doublets[^11][^17]
2. **Chainmail Layer**: Intermediate protection including hauberks, coifs, and other mail items[^11][^17]
3. **Plate Armor**: Provides maximum protection with breastplates, gauntlets, greaves, and pauldrons[^11][^17]
4. **Outer Layer**: Decorative items like surcoats and tabards worn over armor[^11]
5. **Helmets**: Various styles providing different levels of head protection[^11]

## Armor Quality and Tier System

Beyond the layering mechanics, armor quality significantly impacts effectiveness:

- **Bronze Tier**: Basic quality (lowest tier)[^11]
- **Silver Tier**: Intermediate quality (second tier)[^11]
- **Gold Tier**: Premium quality (third tier)[^11]
- **Henry's Quality**: Exclusive top tier, craftable only after unlocking the "Secret of Martin the blacksmith" perk[^11]

Higher quality armor provides improved resistance, better durability, and higher resale value[^11].

## Key Armor Stats and Their Interactions

### Defensive Statistics

Each armor piece contributes to three primary defensive stats:

- **Stab Defense**: Protection against piercing attacks from arrows, spears, and daggers[^11][^14]
- **Slash Defense**: Protection against cutting attacks from swords[^11][^14]
- **Blunt Defense**: Protection against impact damage from maces and hammers[^11][^14]

Different armor types excel against specific damage types. For example, chainmail provides excellent protection against slashing attacks but is vulnerable to blunt force trauma[^11].

### Stealth-Related Statistics

Armor significantly impacts your stealth capabilities through three interconnected stats:

#### 1. Visibility

Visibility determines how far away NPCs can detect Henry[^6][^20]:

- Lower visibility means enemies must be closer to spot you[^6]
- Affected by garment color and type, with bright colors increasing visibility[^6]
- Dark-colored clothing (black, gray, dark green) significantly reduces visibility[^20]
- Environmental lighting also affects practical visibility beyond the clothing stat[^20]


#### 2. Conspicuousness

Conspicuousness measures how quickly NPCs recognize Henry[^5][^12]:

- Calculated as the mean value of all equipped items' individual conspicuousness ratings[^5]
- Scale ranges from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest)[^5]
- Fancy, bright, or distinctive clothing increases conspicuousness[^12][^16]
- Lower conspicuousness extends the time enemies take to recognize you[^5][^20]
- With high conspicuousness, guards become more determined in tracking you if you're spotted[^5]


#### 3. Noise

Noise determines how audible Henry is while moving[^7][^14]:

- Material type heavily influences noise level (plate and mail armor are loudest)[^7][^11]
- Leather and cloth materials produce less noise[^7]
- Crouching reduces noise by 50%[^7]
- Movement type affects noise (walking vs. running)[^14]


## How Layering Affects Overall Stats

When multiple armor pieces are layered together, their combined effect on stats works as follows:

### For Defensive Stats

- Defensive values from all armor pieces stack cumulatively[^10]
- Some UI elements may show the armor value being added twice (possible visual bug)[^10]


### For Stealth Stats

- **Conspicuousness**: Calculated as the mean value of all equipped items[^5]
- **Visibility**: Outer layers can partially override inner layers, with dark outer garments helping to conceal bright underclothing[^14]
- **Noise**: Determined by the materials of all armor pieces, with louder pieces having a greater impact on the overall noise stat[^11]


## Strategic Considerations and Outfit Management

### Multiple Outfit System

KCD2 allows players to save up to three different outfits for quick swapping[^9][^4]:

- Create specialized loadouts for different situations (combat, stealth, social interactions)
- Switch between outfits from the inventory menu without manually changing each piece


### Situational Optimization

Different scenarios call for different armor priorities:

1. **Combat Focus**: Prioritize defensive stats and wear full layered armor regardless of stealth penalties[^11]
2. **Stealth Operations**: Wear dark, lightweight clothing with minimal noise to reduce detection[^20]
3. **Social Interactions**: Consider charisma-boosting clothing for improved speech options[^14]
4. **Balanced Approach**: Mid-tier armor with moderate protection and acceptable stealth properties

## Conclusion

Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's armor system represents a remarkable commitment to historical accuracy while providing meaningful gameplay implications. The mandatory layering creates a deeper level of immersion and strategic planning for character equipment. Understanding how visibility, conspicuousness, and noise interact with your armor choices is essential for mastering both combat and stealth approaches to gameplay.

By carefully selecting appropriate gear for different situations and leveraging the game's outfit management system, players can optimize their performance across various gameplay scenarios while maintaining historical authenticity.
