### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is the mod on Steam Workshop?
Yes, it’s uploaded.

#### How do I install it?
Use Vortex Mod Manager or extract the contents of the mod into the `{Game}\Mods` folder.

#### Why does it remove helmets in quests, blocking progress?
Helmets may be removed in quests (e.g., sparring with Hans), halting progression. As of game version 1.2 (March 13, 2025), the unexposed QuestSystem prevents fixes. Still under review.

#### Why aren’t some helmets detected?
Early versions struggled with helmet detection. Improved in 1.0.3, and the version 1.1.1 (March 15, 2025) uses a better method for head armor identification.

#### Why doesn’t headgear reequip after outfit switches?
Switching outfits mid-dialogue (e.g., merchant trades) may not reequip headgear, and empty slots can fill permanently. This version 1.1.1 improves this, but issues may linger.

#### Why isn’t my helmet cleaned at baths?
Bathmaids skip helmets since they’re removed. No game option exists to clean all gear.

#### Can it remove crossbows/bows instead?
Users like Revan770 suggest removing clipping crossbows/bows. Delayed due to time constraints; fixing current issues takes priority.

#### Can it remove just the helmet, not the coif?
Yes, the "Helmet Only" variant (requested by Anders00n and AestheticAdvocate) removes only the helmet.

#### Can I toggle helmet removal in-game?
A hotkey toggle (suggested by 1lllrjsghll1) isn’t available yet due to time constraints but is planned.

#### Why no helmet removal in cutscenes/scripted talks?
Helmets (e.g., Brunswick’s) stay on in cutscenes or scripted dialogues (per mpoutias56). Game version 1.2 limits fixes, though the version 1.1.1 helps. An idea based on "Dialog Sharpening Be Gone" mod is pending free time.

#### Could you make a mod to keep visor position in cutscenes/dialogues?
Many users have suggested a variant where the visor stays in its manually set position (up or down) during cutscenes and dialogues. This isn’t possible yet, as no relevant API functions exist to control visor state.
