### "Easy Riders" Quest Now Unblocked in KCD2
In the "Easy Riders" quest, players can now progress seamlessly. As of version 1.3.2 (March 19, 2025), the update fixes the previous issue where helmets or was removed, preventing you from sparring with Hans.

### Why aren’t some helmets detected?
Early versions struggled with helmet detection. Improved in 1.0.3, and the version 1.1.1 (March 15, 2025) uses a better method for equipped gear identification.

### Can it remove crossbows/bows instead?
Yes, this is now supported in version 1.2.0 (March 16, 2025).

### Can it remove just the helmet, not the coif?
Yes, the optional "Helmet Only" mod removes only the helmet.

### Can I toggle helmet removal in-game?
A hotkey toggle isn’t available yet due to time constraints but is planned.

### Why no helmet removal in scripted talks?

### Why no helmet removal in cutscenes talks?
As of version 1.3.0 (16-Mar-25), helmet removal in cutscenes should be supported. *Update*: There has been a few reports from players suggesting this might actually not work. Pending investigation.

### Could you make a mod to keep visor position in cutscenes/dialogues?
Many users have suggested an optional mod where the visor stays in its manually set position (up or down) during cutscenes and dialogues. I have not been able to find a way to do this; no relevant API functions exist to control visor state. If you have any idea for how to do this, please do comment.

### What about when speaking to Mutt (KCD 1)?
As of version 1.3.0 (16-Mar-25), helmet removal when speaking to Mutt is now supported.

### Why doesn’t my gear get taken off when speaking to people offering bathhouse services?
As of version 1.3.4, the mod skips gear take-off when interacting with bathhouse NPCs. This is a temporary workaround to avoid the issue where headgear taken off during the interaction isn’t washed. Once a method is developed to detect when Henry confirms the dialogue option to wash his clothes, gear take-off will be re-enabled.
