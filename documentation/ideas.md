### Vision

Create a mod that adjusts visor behavior during cutscenes and dialogue. The visor would remain in the position manually set by the player—staying up if raised, or down if lowered—throughout cutscenes and dialogues. This would offer a more immersive and customizable experience, contrasting with the default behavior, and could appeal to players seeking varied playthrough styles.
