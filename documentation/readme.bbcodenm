This mod automatically takes off your helmet, head chainmail (KCD 1) and coif when starting a conversation with an NPC, then puts them back on when the dialog ends.

If you identify any head armour not listed below, please provide their full names as they appear in-game.
[/quote]
[list]
[*] Helmets: kettle, bascinet, helmet, skullcap
[*] Head Chainmail (for KCD 1): coifmail, nm_ca_collar, nm_ca_hood
[*] Coifs: coif, [b]g_hood_[/b]
[/list]

[size=5]Mod Variants[/size]
[list]
[*] [b]Main:[/b] Takes off helmet, head chainmail (KCD 1), and coif at the start of every dialogue and puts them back on when the conversation ends. Install only one mod variant.
[*] [b]Random:[/b] Takes off helmet, head chainmail (KCD 1), and coif in random dialogues rather than every time. For instance, it might take them off in one conversation but keep them on in the next. Install only one mod variant.
[list]
[*] As a player, this reflects my reason for creating this mod—half because I expect I’ll grow tired of Henry’s face, and half because the helmets are really cool to look at, especially when switching between different ones.[/list]
[*] [b]Helmet-Only:[/b] Takes off helmet at the start of every dialogue and puts them back on when the conversation ends, unlike the main variant, leaving head chainmail (KCD 1) and coif unchanged. Install only one mod variant.
[/list]
[size=5]Caveats[/size]
[list]
[*] [b]Charisma Impact[/b]: Taking off the helmet or coif during dialogue will probably lower charisma, as these items contribute to that stat. I don’t plan to address this, as high charisma is achievable without them, and it’s an acceptable trade-off for the mod’s functionality.
[*] [b]Not All Helmets[/b]: I play slowly (still on the first KCD 2 map after a restart), so I haven’t tested every helmet yet. That said, this mod should work with at least 90% of helmets—like kettles and bascinets. If you find one that doesn’t work, please let me know, so I can address it.
[*] [b]Non-Helmet Items[/b]: Head armour like hats remains unaffected by this mod.
[*] [b]Hack: IsEquipped[/b]: Neither KCD 2 nor KCD 1 provides a Lua API function to retrieve equipped slot items. To address this, the mod uses a hack. It iterates through all helmets and coifs in the player's inventory, taking them off. If the player's equipped weight changes, the mod identifies that item as the one equipped.
